<h2>PUBLISHERS' NOTE</h2>


<p>The Bible for Young People tells the sweet and simple stories
of the Bible in the Bible language, omitting only genealogies and
doctrines, and whatever is generally regarded as unprofitable to
young readers. Moreover, it is so divided into subjects, forming
complete stories, that the child will be interested in every part of it.
The life of Jesus is put together in a continuous account taken from
the four Evangelists; and while there are omissions and changes,
the wording and spelling of the King James version remain the same.</p>

<p>Verse divisions have been disregarded, and a totally new system
of chapters introduced in place of the familiar ones, and it is hoped
that this novelty will give fresh interest to the old book. One of
the features which will be appreciated is the table of contents, giving
the subject of each book and its subdivisions, so that one may
readily turn to any Bible story of which he is in search.</p>

<p>With great discrimination and sympathy, the compiler, Mrs.
Joseph B. Gilder, has accomplished this task, and the book now
stands as the embodiment of what is universally considered the
best in the Bible for young people, "best" meaning here what is
most suited to the minds of girls and boys and appropriate to their
moral range.</p>

<small>THE CREATION OF THE WORLD</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 1</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="150" height="173" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">IN the beginning
God created
the heaven
and the
earth. And
the earth was
without form,
and void; and
darkness was
upon the face
of the deep.
And the Spirit of God moved upon
the face of the waters. And God
said, Let there be light: and there
was light. And God saw the light,
that it was good: and God divided
the light from the darkness. And
God called the light Day, and the
darkness he called Night. And the
evening and the morning were the
first day.</div>

<p>And God said, Let there be a firmament
in the midst of the waters,
and let it divide the waters from the
waters. And God made the firmament,
and divided the waters which
were under the firmament from the
waters which were above the firmament:
and it was so. And God called
the firmament Heaven. And the
evening and the morning were the
second day.</p>

<p>And God said, Let the waters
under the heaven be gathered together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
unto one place, and let the dry
land appear: and it was so. And
God called the dry land Earth; and
the gathering together of the waters
called he Seas: and God saw that it
was good. And God said, Let the
earth bring forth grass, the herb
yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding
fruit after his kind, whose seed is
in itself, upon the earth: and it was
so. And the earth brought forth
grass, and herb yielding seed after
his kind, and the tree yielding fruit,
whose seed was in itself, after his
kind: and God saw that it was good.
And the evening and the morning
were the third day.</p>

<p>And God said, Let there be lights
in the firmament of the heaven to
divide the day from the night; and
let them be for signs, and for seasons,
and for days, and years: and let
them be for lights in the firmament
of the heaven to give light upon the
earth: and it was so. And God made
two great lights; the greater light to
rule the day, and the lesser light to
rule the night: he made the stars
also. And God set them in the firmament
of the heaven to give light
upon the earth, and to rule over the
day and over the night, and to divide
the light from the darkness: and God
saw that it was good. And the evening
and the morning were the fourth
day.</p>

<p>And God said, Let the waters bring
forth abundantly the moving creature
that hath life, and fowl that may
fly above the earth in the open firmament
of heaven. And God created
great whales, and every living creature
that moveth, which the waters
brought forth abundantly, after their
kind, and every winged fowl after
his kind: and God saw that it was
good. And God blessed them, saying,
Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
the waters in the seas, and let fowl
multiply in the earth. And the evening
and the morning were the fifth
day.</p>


<p>And God said, Let the earth bring
forth the living creature after his
kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and
beast of the earth after his kind:
and it was so. And God made the
beast of the earth after his kind, and
cattle after their kind, and every
thing that creepeth upon the earth
after his kind: and God saw that it
was good. And God said, Let us
make man in our image, after our
likeness: and let them have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the
fowl of the air, and over the cattle,
and over all the earth, and over every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth. So God created man in his
own image, in the image of God created
he him; male and female created
he them. And God blessed them, and
God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and
subdue it: and have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air, and over every living thing
that moveth upon the earth. And
God said, Behold, I have given you
every herb bearing seed, which is
upon the face of all the earth, and
every tree, in the which is the fruit of
a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be
for meat. And to every beast of the
earth, and to every fowl of the air,
and to every thing that creepeth upon
the earth, wherein there is life, I have
given every green herb for meat:
and it was so. And God saw every
thing that he had made, and, behold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
it was very good. And the evening
and the morning were the sixth
day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 2</div>

<p>Thus the heavens and the earth
were finished, and all the host of
them. And on the seventh day God
ended his work which he had made;
and he rested on the seventh day from
all his work which he had made. And
God blessed the seventh day, and
sanctified it: because that in it he had
rested from all his work which God
created and made.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2" id="CHAPTER_2">CHAPTER 2</a><br />

<small>THE CREATION OF ADAM
AND EVE</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THESE are the generations of
the heavens and of the earth
when they were created, in
the day that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God made the
earth and the heavens, and every
plant of the field before it was in the
earth, and every herb of the field
before it grew: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God had
not caused it to rain upon the earth,
and there was not a man to till the
ground. But there went up a mist
from the earth, and watered the
whole face of the ground. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God formed man of the dust of
the ground, and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life; and man
became a living soul.</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God planted a garden
eastward in Eden; and there he
put the man whom he had formed.
And out of the ground made the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
God to grow every tree that is pleasant
to the sight, and good for food;
the tree of life also in the midst of
the garden, and the tree of knowledge
of good and evil. And a river went
out of Eden to water the garden; and
from thence it was parted, and became
into four heads.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God took the man,
and put him into the garden of Eden
to dress it and to keep it. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God commanded the man, saying,
Of every tree of the garden thou
mayest freely eat: but of the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil, thou
shalt not eat of it: for in the day that
thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
die.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God said, It is not
good that the man should be alone;
I will make him an help meet for him.
And out of the ground the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God
formed every beast of the field, and
every fowl of the air; and brought
them unto Adam to see what he would
call them: and whatsoever Adam
called every living creature, that was
the name thereof. And Adam gave
names to all cattle, and to the fowl
of the air, and to every beast of the
field; but for Adam there was not
found an help meet for him.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God caused a deep
sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept:
and he took one of his ribs, and closed
up the flesh instead thereof; and the
rib, which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God had taken
from man, made he a woman, and
brought her unto the man. And
Adam said, This is now bone of my
bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall
be called Woman, because she was
taken out of Man. Therefore shall a
man leave his father and his mother,
and shall cleave unto his wife: and
they shall be one flesh. And they
were both naked, the man and his
wife, and were not ashamed.</p>

<small>THE SIN OF ADAM AND EVE</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 3</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>NOW the serpent was more subtil
than any beast of the field
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God had
made. And he said unto the woman,
Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat
of every tree of the garden?</div>

<p>And the woman said unto the serpent,
We may eat of the fruit of the
trees of the garden: but of the fruit
of the tree which is in the midst of
the garden, God hath said, Ye shall
not eat of it, neither shall ye touch
it, lest ye die.</p>

<p>And the serpent said unto the woman,
Ye shall not surely die: for
God doth know that in the day ye
eat thereof, then your eyes shall be
opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing
good and evil.</p>

<p>And when the woman saw that the
tree was good for food, and that it
was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree
to be desired to make one wise, she
took of the fruit thereof, and did eat,
and gave also unto her husband with
her; and he did eat. And the eyes
of them both were opened, and they
knew that they were naked; and they
sewed fig leaves together, and made
themselves aprons.</p>

<p>And they heard the voice of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God walking in the garden in
the cool of the day: and Adam and
his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God amongst the
trees of the garden.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God called unto
Adam, and said unto him, Where art
thou?</p>

<p>And he said, I heard thy voice in
the garden, and I was afraid, because
I was naked; and I hid myself.</p>

<p>And he said, Who told thee that
thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten
of the tree, whereof I commanded
thee that thou shouldest not eat?</p>

<p>And the man said, The woman
whom thou gavest to be with me, she
gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God said unto the
woman, What is this that thou hast
done? And the woman said, The serpent
beguiled me, and I did eat.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God said unto the
serpent, Because thou hast done this,
thou art cursed above all cattle, and
above every beast of the field; upon
thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
thou eat all the days of thy life: and
I will put enmity between thee and
the woman, and between thy seed and
her seed; it shall bruise thy head,
and thou shalt bruise his heel.</p>

<p>Unto the woman he said, I will
greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring
forth children; and thy desire shall
be to thy husband, and he shall rule
over thee.</p>

<p>And unto Adam he said, Because
thou hast hearkened unto the voice
of thy wife, and hast eaten of the
tree, of which I commanded thee, saying,
Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed
is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow
shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy
life; thorns also and thistles shall it
bring forth to thee; and thou shalt
eat the herb of the field; in the sweat
of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till
thou return unto the ground; for out
of it wast thou taken: for dust
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou
return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>And Adam called his wife's name
Eve; because she was the mother of
all living.</p>

<p>Unto Adam also and to his wife did
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God make coats of skins, and
clothed them.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God said, Behold,
the man is become as one of us, to
know good and evil: and now, lest
he put forth his hand, and take also
of the tree of life, and eat, and live
for ever: therefore the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God
sent him forth from the garden of
Eden, to till the ground from whence
he was taken. So he drove out the
man; and he placed at the east of the
garden of Eden Cherubims, and a
flaming sword which turned every
way, to keep the way of the tree of
life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_4" id="CHAPTER_4">CHAPTER 4</a><br />

<small>THE MURDER OF ABEL</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Genesis 4</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Eve bare Cain, and said,
I have gotten a man from
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And she again
bare his brother Abel. And Abel
was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was
a tiller of the ground.</div>

<p>And in process of time it came to
pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of
the ground an offering unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings
of his flock and of the fat thereof.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had respect unto
Abel and to his offering: but unto
Cain and to his offering he had not
respect.</p>

<p>And Cain was very wroth, and his
countenance fell.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Cain,
Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen? If thou doest
well, shalt thou not be accepted? and
if thou doest not well, sin lieth at
the door. And unto thee shall be his
desire, and thou shalt rule over
him.</p>

<p>And Cain talked with Abel his brother:
and it came to pass, when they
were in the field, that Cain rose up
against Abel his brother, and slew
him. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Cain,
Where is Abel thy brother?</p>

<p>And he said, I know not: Am I my
brother's keeper?</p>

<p>And he said, What hast thou done?
the voice of thy brother's blood crieth
unto me from the ground. And
now art thou cursed from the earth,
which hath opened her mouth to receive
thy brother's blood from thy
hand; when thou tillest the ground,
it shall not henceforth yield unto thee
her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond
shalt thou be in the earth. And
Cain said unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, My punishment
is greater than I can bear.
Behold, thou hast driven me out this
day from the face of the earth; and
from thy face shall I be hid; and I
shall be a fugitive and a vagabond
in the earth; and it shall come to pass,
that every one that findeth me shall
slay me. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto
him, Therefore whosoever slayeth
Cain, vengeance shall be taken on
him sevenfold. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> set
a mark upon Cain, lest any finding
him should kill him.</p>

<p>And Cain went out from the presence
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and dwelt in the
land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
And Cain's wife bare Enoch: and he
builded a city, and called the name
of the city, after the name of his son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Enoch. And from Enoch was descended
Lamech.</p>

<p>And Lamech took unto him two
wives: the name of the one was Adah,
and the name of the other Zillah.
And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father
of such as dwell in tents, and of
such as have cattle. And his brother's
name was Jubal: he was the
father of all such as handle the harp
and organ. And Zillah, she also bare
Tubal-cain, an instructer of every artificer
in brass and iron.</p>

<p>And Eve again bare a son, and
called his name Seth: For God, said
she, hath appointed me another seed
instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
And to Seth, to him also there was
born a son; and he called his name
Enos. And from Enos was descended
Enoch. And Enoch walked with
God: and he was not; for God took
him. And from Enoch was descended
Methuselah, who lived nine hundred
sixty and nine years, and had
a son Lamech, whose son was Noah.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_5" id="CHAPTER_5">CHAPTER 5</a><br />

<small>THE FLOOD</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 6</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, when men
began to multiply on the face
of the earth, that <span class="smcap">God</span> saw
that the wickedness of man was great
in the earth, and that every imagination
of the thoughts of his heart was
only evil continually. And it repented
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that he had made
man on the earth, and it grieved him
at his heart. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said, I
will destroy man whom I have created
from the face of the earth; both
man, and beast, and the creeping
thing, and the fowls of the air; for
it repenteth me that I have made
them. But Noah found grace in the
eyes of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</div>


<p>Noah was a just man and walked
with God. And Noah begat three
sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</p>

<p>The earth also was corrupt before
God, and the earth was filled with
violence. And God looked upon the
earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for
all flesh had corrupted his way upon
the earth.</p>

<p>And God said unto Noah, The end
of all flesh is come before me; for the
earth is filled with violence through
them; and, behold, I will destroy them
with the earth. Make thee an ark of
gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make
in the ark, and shalt pitch it within
and without with pitch. And this is
the fashion which thou shalt make it
of: The length of the ark shall be
three hundred cubits, the breadth of
it fifty cubits, and the height of it
thirty cubits. A window shalt thou
make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt
thou finish it above; and the door of
the ark shalt thou set in the side
thereof; with lower, second, and third
stories shalt thou make it.</p>

<p>And, behold, I, even I, do bring a
flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy
all flesh, wherein is the breath
of life, from under heaven; and every
thing that is in the earth shall die.
But with thee will I establish my covenant;
and thou shalt come into the
ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife,
and thy sons' wives with thee.</p>

<p>And of every living thing of all
flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring
into the ark, to keep them alive with
thee; they shall be male and female.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle
after their kind, of every creeping
thing of the earth after his kind, two
of every sort shall come unto thee,
to keep them alive. And take thou
unto thee of all food that is eaten, and
thou shalt gather it to thee; and it
shall be for food for thee, and for
them. Thus did Noah; according
to all that God commanded him, so
did he. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto
Noah, Come thou and all thy house
into the ark; for thee have I seen
righteous before me in this generation.
Of every clean beast thou shalt
take to thee by sevens, the male and
his female: and of beasts that are not
clean by two, the male and his female.
Of fowls also of the air by sevens,
the male and the female; to keep seed
alive upon the face of all the earth.
For yet seven days, and I will cause
it to rain upon the earth forty days
and forty nights; and every living
substance that I have made will I destroy
from off the face of the earth.
And Noah did according unto all that
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded him. And Noah
was six hundred years old when the
flood of waters was upon the earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 7</div>

<p>And Noah went in, and his sons,
and his wife, and his sons' wives with
him, into the ark, because of the waters
of the flood. Of clean beasts,
and of beasts that are not clean, and
of fowls, and of every thing that
creepeth upon the earth, there went
in two and two unto Noah into the
ark, the male and the female, as God
had commanded Noah.</p>

<p>And it came to pass after seven
days, that the waters of the flood were
upon the earth. In the six hundredth
year of Noah's life, in the second
month, the seventeenth day of the
month, the same day were all the
fountains of the great deep broken
up, and the windows of heaven were
opened. And the rain was upon the
earth forty days and forty nights.</p>

<p>In the selfsame day entered Noah,
and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife,
and the three wives of his sons with
them, into the ark; they, and every
beast after his kind, and all the cattle
after their kind, and every creeping
thing that creepeth upon the earth
after his kind, and every fowl after
his kind, every bird of every sort.
And they went in unto Noah into the
ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein
is the breath of life. And they that
went in, went in male and female of
all flesh, as God had commanded him:
and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shut him in.</p>

<p>And the flood was forty days upon
the earth; and the waters increased,
and bare up the ark, and it was lift
up above the earth. And the waters
prevailed, and were increased greatly
upon the earth; and the ark went
upon the face of the waters. And
the waters prevailed exceedingly
upon the earth; and all the high hills,
that were under the whole heaven,
were covered. Fifteen cubits upward
did the waters prevail; and the mountains
were covered.</p>

<p>And all flesh died that moved upon
the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle,
and of beast, and of every creeping
thing that creepeth upon the earth,
and every man: all in whose nostrils
was the breath of life, of all that was
in the dry land, died. And every living
substance was destroyed which
was upon the face of the ground, both
man, and cattle, and the creeping
things, and the fowl of the heaven;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and they were destroyed from the
earth: and Noah only remained alive,
and they that were with him in the
ark. And the waters prevailed upon
the earth an hundred and fifty days.</p>

stopped, and the rain from heaven
was restrained; and the waters returned
from off the earth continually:
and after the end of the hundred and
fifty days the waters were abated.</div>

<p>And the ark rested in the seventh
month, on the seventeenth day of the
month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
And the waters decreased continually
until the tenth month: in the
tenth month, on the first day of the
month, were the tops of the mountains
seen.</p>

<p>And it came to pass at the end of
forty days, that Noah opened the window
of the ark which he had made:
and he sent forth a raven, which
went forth to and fro, until the waters
were dried up from off the earth.
Also he sent forth a dove from him,
to see if the waters were abated from
off the face of the ground; but the
dove found no rest for the sole of her
foot, and she returned unto him into
the ark, for the waters were on the
face of the whole earth: then he put
forth his hand, and took her, and
pulled her in unto him into the ark.</p>

<p>And he stayed yet other seven
days; and again he sent forth the
dove out of the ark; and the dove
came in to him in the evening; and,
lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf
pluckt off: so Noah knew that the
waters were abated from off the
earth. And he stayed yet other seven
days; and sent forth the dove; which
returned not again unto him any
more.</p>

<p>And it came to pass in the six hundredth
and first year, in the first
month, the first day of the month,
the waters were dried up from off the
earth: and Noah removed the covering
of the ark, and looked, and, behold,
the face of the ground was dry.
And in the second month, on the
seven and twentieth day of the month,
was the earth dried.</p>

<p>And God spake unto Noah, saying,
Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy
wife, and thy sons, and thy sons'
wives with thee. Bring forth with
thee every living thing that is with
thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of
cattle, and of every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth; that
they may breed abundantly in the
earth, and be fruitful, and multiply
upon the earth. And Noah went
forth, and his sons, and his wife, and
his sons' wives with him: every beast,
every creeping thing, and every fowl,
and whatsoever creepeth upon the
earth, after their kinds, went forth
out of the ark.</p>

<p>And Noah builded an altar unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and took of every clean beast,
and of every clean fowl, and offered
burnt offerings on the altar. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> smelled a sweet savour; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> said in his heart, I will not
again curse the ground any more for
man's sake; for the imagination of
man's heart is evil from his youth;
neither will I again smite any more
every thing living, as I have done.
While the earth remaineth, seedtime
and harvest, and cold and heat, and
summer and winter, and day and
night shall not cease.</p>

<p>And God blessed Noah and his
sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful,
and multiply, and replenish the
earth. And the fear of you and the
dread of you shall be upon every
beast of the earth, and upon every
fowl of the air, upon all that moveth
upon the earth, and upon all the fishes
of the sea; into your hand are they
delivered. Every moving thing that
liveth shall be meat for you; even as
the green herb have I given you all
things. But flesh with the life thereof,
which is the blood thereof, shall
ye not eat.</p>

<p>And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply;
bring forth abundantly in the
earth, and multiply therein.</p>

<p>And God spake unto Noah, and to
his sons with him, saying, And I,
behold, I establish my covenant with
you, and with your seed after you;
and with every living creature that
is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle,
and of every beast of the earth with
you; from all that go out of the ark,
to every beast of the earth. And I
will establish my covenant with you;
neither shall all flesh be cut off any
more by the waters of a flood; neither
shall there any more be a flood to destroy
the earth.</p>

<p>And God said, This is the token
of the covenant which I make between
me and you and every living creature
that is with you, for perpetual generations:
I do set my bow in the cloud,
and it shall be for a token of a covenant
between me and the earth. And
it shall come to pass, when I bring a
cloud over the earth, that the bow
shall be seen in the cloud: and I will
remember my covenant, which is between
me and you and every living
creature of all flesh; and the waters
shall no more become a flood to destroy
all flesh. And the bow shall be
in the cloud; and I will look upon it,
that I may remember the everlasting
covenant between God and every living
creature of all flesh that is upon
the earth. And God said unto Noah,
This is the token of the covenant,
which I have established between me
and all flesh that is upon the earth.</p>

<p>And the sons of Noah, that went
forth of the ark, were Shem, and
Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the
father of Canaan. These are the
three sons of Noah: and of them was
the whole earth overspread.</p>

<p>And Noah lived after the flood
three hundred and fifty years. And
all the days of Noah were nine hundred
and fifty years: and he died.</p>

<small>THE TOWER OF BABEL</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 11</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND the whole earth was of one
language, and of one speech.
And it came to pass, as they
journeyed from the east, that they
found a plain in the land of Shinar;
and they dwelt there. And they said
one to another, Go to, let us make
brick, and burn them throughly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
And they had brick for stone, and
slime had they for morter. And they
said, Go to, let us build us a city and
a tower, whose top may reach unto
heaven; and let us make us a name,
lest we be scattered abroad upon the
face of the whole earth.</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came down to see the
city and the tower, which the children
of men builded. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said,
Behold, the people is one, and they

begin to do: and now nothing will
be restrained from them, which they
have imagined to do. Go to, let us
go down, and there confound their

thence upon the face of all the earth:
and they left off to build the city.
Therefore is the name of it called
Babel; because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> did there
confound the language of all the

scatter them abroad upon the face of

<h2>BOOK II&mdash;ABRAHAM AND ISAAC</h2>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_8" id="CHAPTER_8">CHAPTER 8</a><br />

<small>THE CALL OF ABRAM</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="150" height="173" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">AND Abram was the
son of Terah, who
was descended
from Shem. Terah
begat Abram,
Nahor, and Haran;
and Haran
begat Lot. And
Abram and Nahor
took them wives: the name of
Abram's wife was Sarai; and the
name of Nahor's wife, Milcah. But
Sarai had no child. And Terah took
Abram his son, and Lot the son of
Haran his son's son, and Sarai his
daughter in law, his son Abram's
wife; and they went forth with them
from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into
the land of Canaan; and they came
unto Haran, and dwelt there. And
Terah died in Haran.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 12</div>

<p>Now the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had said unto Abram,
Get thee out of thy country, and from
thy kindred, and from thy father's
house, unto a land that I will shew
thee: and I will make of thee a great
nation, and I will bless thee, and
make thy name great; and thou shalt
be a blessing: and I will bless them
that bless thee, and curse him that
curseth thee: and in thee shall all
families of the earth be blessed.</p>

<p>So Abram departed, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
had spoken unto him; and Lot went
with him: and Abram was seventy
and five years old when he departed
out of Haran. And Abram took Sarai
his wife, and Lot his brother's son,
and all their substance that they had
gathered, and the souls that they
had gotten in Haran; and they went
forth to go into the land of Canaan;
and into the land of Canaan they
came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>And Abram passed through the
land unto the place of Sichem, unto
the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite
was then in the land. And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared unto Abram, and
said, Unto thy seed will I give this
land: and there builded he an altar
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, who appeared unto
him. And he removed from thence
unto a mountain on the east of Beth-el,
and pitched his tent, having Beth-el
on the west, and Hai on the east:
and there he builded an altar unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and called upon the name
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Abram journeyed,
going on still toward the south.</p>

<p>And there was a famine in the
land: and Abram went down into
Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine
was grievous in the land. And it
came to pass, when he was come near
to enter into Egypt, that he said unto
Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know
that thou art a fair woman to look
upon: therefore it shall come to pass,
when the Egyptians shall see thee,
that they shall say, This is his wife:
and they will kill me, but they will
save thee alive. Say, I pray thee,
thou art my sister: that it may be
well with me for thy sake; and my
soul shall live because of thee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 13</div>

<p>And it came to pass, that, when
Abram was come into Egypt, the
Egyptians beheld the woman that she
was very fair: and the woman was
taken into Pharaoh's house. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> plagued Pharaoh and his house
with great plagues because of Sarai
Abram's wife. And Pharaoh called
Abram, and said, What is this that
thou hast done unto me? why didst
thou not tell me that she was thy
wife? Why saidst thou, She is my
sister? so I might have taken her to
me to wife: now therefore behold
thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
And Abram went up out of Egypt,
he, and his wife, and all that he had,
and Lot with him, into the south.
And Abram was very rich in cattle,
in silver, and in gold. And he went
on his journeys from the south even
to Beth-el, unto the place of the altar,
which he had made there at the
first: and there Abram called on the
name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>


<p>And Lot also, which went with
Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
tents. And the land was not able to
bear them: for their substance was
great, so that they could not dwell together.
And there was a strife between
the herdmen of Abram's cattle
and the herdmen of Lot's cattle. And
Abram said unto Lot, Let there be
no strife, I pray thee, between me and
thee, and between my herdmen and
thy herdmen; for we be brethren. Is
not the whole land before thee? separate
thyself, I pray thee, from me: if
thou wilt take the left hand, then I
will go to the right; or if thou depart
to the right hand, then I will go to
the left. And Lot lifted up his eyes,
and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
that it was well watered every where,
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> destroyed Sodom
and Gomorrah, even as the garden
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, like the land of Egypt,
as thou comest unto Zoar. Then Lot
chose him all the plain of Jordan;
and Lot journeyed east: and they
separated themselves the one from
the other. Abram dwelled in the
land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in
the cities of the plain, and pitched his
tent toward Sodom. But the men of
Sodom were wicked and sinners before
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Abram,
after that Lot was separated from
him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look
from the place where thou art northward,
and southward, and eastward,
and westward: for all the land which
thou seest, to thee will I give it, and
to thy seed for ever. And I will
make thy seed as the dust of the
earth: so that if a man can number
the dust of the earth, then shall thy
seed also be numbered. Arise, walk
through the land in the length of it
and in the breadth of it; for I will
give it unto thee. Then Abram removed
his tent, and came and dwelt
in the plain of Mamre, which is in
Hebron, and built there an altar unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>[And it came to pass that there was
a battle in the vale of Siddim, by the
Dead Sea: four kings fought against
five. And among the five were the
kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, where
Lot dwelt.]</p>

<p>And the vale of Siddim was full of
slimepits; and the kings of Sodom
and Gomorrah fled, and fell there;
and they that remained fled to the
mountain. And they took all the
goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and
all their victuals, and went their way.
And they took Lot, Abram's brother's
son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his
goods, and departed.</p>

<p>And there came one that had escaped,
and told Abram the Hebrew.
And when Abram heard that his brother
was taken captive, he armed his
trained servants, born in his own
house, three hundred and eighteen,
and pursued them unto Dan. And
he divided himself against them, he
and his servants, by night, and smote
them, and pursued them unto Hobah,
which is on the left hand of Damascus.
And he brought back all the
goods, and also brought again his brother
Lot, and his goods, and the women
also, and the people.</p>

<p>And the king of Sodom went out
to meet him after his return from the
slaughter of the kings. And Melchizedek
king of Salem brought forth
bread and wine: and he was the priest
of the most high God. And he
blessed him, and said, Blessed be
Abram of the most high God, possessor
of heaven and earth: and blessed
be the most high God, which hath delivered
thine enemies into thy hand.
And he gave him tithes of all. And
the king of Sodom said unto Abram,
Give me the persons, and take the
goods to thyself. And Abram said
to the king of Sodom, I have lift up
mine hand unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the most
high God, the possessor of heaven
and earth, that I will not take from a
thread even to a shoelatchet, and that
I will not take any thing that is thine,
lest thou shouldest say, I have made
Abram rich: save only that which the
young men have eaten, and the portion
of the men which went with me,
Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them
take their portion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 15</div>

<p>After these things the word of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> came unto Abram in a vision,
saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy
shield, and thy exceeding great reward.</p>

<p>And Abram said, Lord God, what
wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless?</p>

<p>And he brought him forth abroad,
and said, Look now toward heaven,
and tell the stars, if thou be able to
number them: and he said unto him,
So shall thy seed be. And he believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and he counted it
to him for righteousness.</p>

<p>And he said unto him, I am the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> that brought thee out of Ur of
the Chaldees, to give thee this land
to inherit it. And he said, Lord
<span class="smcap">God</span>, whereby shall I know that I
shall inherit it? And he said unto
him, Take me an heifer of three
years old, and a she goat of three
years old, and a ram of three years
old, and a turtledove, and a young
pigeon. And he took unto him all
these, and divided them in the midst,
and laid each piece one against another:
but the birds divided he not.
And when the fowls came down upon
the carcases, Abram drove them
away. And when the sun was going
down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
and, lo, an horror of great darkness
fell upon him. And he said unto
Abram, Know of a surety that thy
seed shall be a stranger in a land that
is not their's, and shall serve them;
and they shall afflict them four hundred
years; and also that nation,
whom they shall serve, will I judge:
and afterward shall they come out
with great substance. And thou shalt
go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt
be buried in a good old age. But in
the fourth generation they shall come
hither again: for the iniquity of the
Amorites is not yet full. And it
came to pass, that, when the sun went
down, and it was dark, behold a smoking
furnace, and a burning lamp that
passed between those pieces. In the
same day the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> made a covenant
with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed
have I given this land, from the river
of Egypt unto the great river, the
river Euphrates.</p>

<p>Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him
no children: and she had an handmaid,
an Egyptian, whose name was
Hagar. And Sarai Abram's wife
took Hagar her maid the Egyptian,
and gave her to her husband Abram
to be his wife. And when Sarai dealt
hardly with her, she fled from her
face.</p>

<p>And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> found
her by a fountain of water in the wilderness,
by the fountain in the way
to Shur. And he said, Hagar, Sarai's
maid, whence camest thou? and
whither wilt thou go? And she said,
I flee from the face of my mistress
Sarai. And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
said unto her, Return to thy mistress,
and submit thyself under her hands.
I will multiply thy seed exceedingly,
that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
Behold, thou shalt bear a son,
and shalt call his name Ishmael;
because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath heard thy
affliction. And he will be a wild man;
his hand will be against every man,
and every man's hand against him;
and he shall dwell in the presence
of all his brethren.</p>

<p>And she called the name of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> that spake unto her, Thou God
seest me: for she said, Have I also
here looked after him that seeth me?
And Hagar bare Abram a son: and
Abram called his son's name, which
Hagar bare, Ishmael.</p>

<p>And when Abram was ninety years
old and nine, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared to
Abram, and said unto him, I am the
Almighty God; walk before me, and
be thou perfect. And I will make
my covenant between me and thee,
and will multiply thee exceedingly.
And Abram fell on his face: and God
talked with him, saying, As for me,
behold, my covenant is with thee, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
thou shalt be a father of many nations.
Neither shall thy name any
more be called Abram, but thy name
shall be Abraham; for a father of
many nations have I made thee. And
I will make thee exceeding fruitful,
and I will make nations of thee, and
kings shall come out of thee. And
I will establish my covenant between
me and thee and thy seed after thee
in their generations for an everlasting
covenant, to be a God unto thee,
and to thy seed after thee. And I
will give unto thee, and to thy seed
after thee, the land wherein thou art
a stranger, all the land of Canaan,
for an everlasting possession; and I
will be their God.</p>

<p>And God said unto Abraham, As
for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call
her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her
name be. And I will bless her, and
give thee a son also of her: yea, I
will bless her, and she shall be a
mother of nations; kings of people
shall be of her. Then Abraham fell
upon his face, and laughed, and said
in his heart, Shall a child be born
unto him that is an hundred years
old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety
years old, bear? And Abraham said
unto God, O that Ishmael might live
before thee!</p>

<p>And God said, Sarah thy wife shall
bear thee a son indeed; and thou
shalt call his name Isaac: and I will
establish my covenant with him for
an everlasting covenant, and with his
seed after him. And as for Ishmael,
I have heard thee: Behold, I have
blessed him, and will make him fruitful,
and will multiply him exceedingly;
twelve princes shall he beget,
and I will make him a great nation.
But my covenant will I establish with
Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto
thee at this set time in the next
year.</p>

<small>DESTRUCTION OF SODOM</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 18</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared unto
Abraham in the plains of
Mamre: and he sat in the tent
door in the heat of the day; and he
lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo,
three men stood by him: and when he
saw them, he ran to meet them from
the tent door, and bowed himself
toward the ground, and said, My
Lord, if now I have found favour in
thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee,
from thy servant: let a little water, I
pray you, be fetched, and wash your
feet, and rest yourselves under the
tree: and I will fetch a morsel of
bread, and comfort ye your hearts;
after that ye shall pass on: for therefore
are ye come to your servant.
And they said, So do, as thou hast
said.</div>

<p>And Abraham hastened into the
tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
ready quickly three measures of fine
meal, knead it, and make cakes upon
the hearth. And Abraham ran unto
the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and
good, and gave it unto a young man;
and he hasted to dress it. And he
took butter, and milk, and the calf
which he had dressed, and set it before
them; and he stood by them under
the tree, and they did eat. And
the men rose up from thence, and
looked toward Sodom: and Abraham
went with them to bring them on the
way. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said, Shall I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
hide from Abraham that thing which
I do; seeing that Abraham shall surely
become a great and mighty nation,
and all the nations of the earth shall
be blessed in him? For I know him,
that he will command his children and
his household after him, and they
shall keep the way of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to do
justice and judgment; that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
may bring upon Abraham that which
he hath spoken of him.</p>

<div class="caption">THE FLIGHT OF LOT, BY RUBENS<br />

</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said, Because the
cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,
and because their sin is very grievous;
I will go down now, and see
whether they have done altogether
according to the cry of it, which is
come unto me; and if not, I will
know. And the men turned their
faces from thence, and went toward
Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>And Abraham drew near, and said,
Wilt thou also destroy the righteous
with the wicked? Peradventure there
be fifty righteous within the city:
wilt thou also destroy and not spare
the place for the fifty righteous that
are therein? That be far from thee
to do after this manner, to slay the
righteous with the wicked: and that
the righteous should be as the wicked,
that be far from thee: Shall not the
Judge of all the earth do right?</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said, If I find in
Sodom fifty righteous within the city,
then I will spare all the place for
their sakes.</p>

<p>And Abraham answered and said,
Behold now, I have taken upon me
to speak unto the Lord, which am but
dust and ashes: Peradventure there
shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
wilt thou destroy all the city for lack
of five? And he said, If I find there
forty and five, I will not destroy it.
And he spake unto him yet again, and
said, Peradventure there shall be
forty found there. And he said, I
will not do it for forty's sake. And
he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord
be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure
there shall thirty be found
there. And he said, I will not do it,
if I find thirty there.</p>


<p>And he said, Behold now, I have
taken upon me to speak unto the
Lord: Peradventure there shall be
twenty found there. And he said,
I will not destroy it for twenty's
sake.</p>

<p>And he said, Oh let not the Lord
be angry, and I will speak yet but
this once: Peradventure ten shall be
found there. And he said, I will not
destroy it for ten's sake. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> went his way, as soon as he had
left communing with Abraham: and
Abraham returned unto his place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 19</div>

<p>And there came two angels to Sodom
at even; and Lot sat in the gate
of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose
up to meet them; and he bowed himself
with his face toward the ground;
and he said, Behold now, my lords,
turn in, I pray you, into your servant's
house, and tarry all night, and
wash your feet, and ye shall rise up
early, and go on your ways. And
they said, Nay; but we will abide in
the street all night. And he pressed
upon them greatly; and they turned
in unto him, and entered into his
house; and he made them a feast, and
did bake unleavened bread, and they
did eat.</p>

<p>And the men said unto Lot, Hast
thou here any besides? son in law,
and thy sons, and thy daughters, and
whatsoever thou hast in the city,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
bring them out of this place: for we
will destroy this place, because the
cry of them is waxen great before the
face of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath
sent us to destroy it. And Lot went
out, and spake unto his sons in law,
which married his daughters, and
said, Up, get you out of this place;
for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will destroy this city.
But he seemed as one that mocked
unto his sons in law.</p>

<p>And when the morning arose, then
the angels hastened Lot, saying,
Arise, take thy wife, and thy two
daughters, which are here; lest thou
be consumed in the iniquity of the
city. And while he lingered, the
men laid hold upon his hand, and
upon the hand of his wife, and upon
the hand of his two daughters; the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> being merciful unto him: and
they brought him forth, and set him
without the city. And it came to pass,
when they had brought them forth
abroad, that he said, Escape for thy
life; look not behind thee, neither stay
thou in all the plain; escape to the
mountain, lest thou be consumed.</p>

<p>And Lot said unto them, Oh, not
so, my Lord: behold now, thy servant
hath found grace in thy sight, and
thou hast magnified thy mercy, which
thou hast shewed unto me in saving
my life; and I cannot escape to the
mountain, lest some evil take me, and
I die: behold now, this city is near
to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh,
let me escape thither, (is it not a little
one?) and my soul shall live.
And he said unto him, See, I have
accepted thee concerning this thing
also, that I will not overthrow this
city, for the which thou hast spoken.
Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot
do any thing till thou be come
thither. Therefore the name of the
city was called Zoar. The sun was
risen upon the earth when Lot entered
into Zoar. Then the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah
brimstone and fire from the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
out of heaven; and he overthrew
those cities, and all the plain, and all
the inhabitants of the cities, and that
which grew upon the ground. But
his wife looked back from behind him,
and she became a pillar of salt.</p>

<p>And Abraham gat up early in the
morning to the place where he stood
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and he looked toward
Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward
all the land of the plain, and
beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country
went up as the smoke of a furnace.
And it came to pass, when God destroyed
the cities of the plain, that
God remembered Abraham, and sent
Lot out of the midst of the overthrow,
when he overthrew the cities in the
which Lot dwelt.</p>

<small>HAGAR AND ISHMAEL</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 21</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> visited Sarah as
he had said, and she bare
Abraham a son in his old age,
at the set time of which God had
spoken to him. And Abraham called
the name of his son that was born
unto him, whom Sarah bare to him,
Isaac. And Abraham was an hundred
years old, when his son Isaac
was born unto him. And Sarah said,
God hath made me to laugh, so that
all that hear will laugh with me.
And the child grew, and was weaned:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and Abraham made a great feast the
same day that Isaac was weaned.</div>

<div class="caption">THE BANISHMENT OF HAGAR, BY GUERCINO<br />

</div>

<p>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar
the Egyptian, which she had born
unto Abraham, mocking. Wherefore
she said unto Abraham, Cast out
this bondwoman and her son: for the
son of this bondwoman shall not be
heir with my son, even with Isaac.
And the thing was very grievous
in Abraham's sight because of his
son.</p>

<p>And God said unto Abraham, Let
it not be grievous in thy sight because
of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman;
in all that Sarah hath said
unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for
in Isaac shall thy seed be called. And
also of the son of the bondwoman will
I make a nation, because he is thy
seed.</p>

<p>And Abraham rose up early in the
morning, and took bread, and a bottle
of water, and gave it unto Hagar,
putting it on her shoulder, and the
child, and sent her away: and she departed,
and wandered in the wilderness
of Beer-sheba. And the water
was spent in the bottle, and she cast
the child under one of the shrubs.
And she went, and sat her down over
against him a good way off, as it were
a bowshot: for she said, Let me not
see the death of the child. And she
sat over against him, and lift up her
voice, and wept. And God heard the
voice of the lad; and the angel of God
called to Hagar out of heaven, and
said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?
fear not; for God hath heard
the voice of the lad where he is.
Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him
in thine hand; for I will make him a
great nation. And God opened her
eyes, and she saw a well of water; and
she went, and filled the bottle with
water, and gave the lad drink.</p>

<p>And God was with the lad; and he
grew, and dwelt in the wilderness,
and became an archer. And he dwelt
in the wilderness of Paran: and his
mother took him a wife out of the
land of Egypt.</p>

<small>ABRAHAM'S SACRIFICE</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 22</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass after these
things, that God did tempt
Abraham, and said unto him,
Abraham: and he said, Behold, here
I am. And he said, Take now thy
son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
lovest, and get thee into the land of
Moriah; and offer him there for a
burnt offering upon one of the mountains
which I will tell thee of.</div>

<p>And Abraham rose up early in the
morning, and saddled his ass, and
took two of his young men with him,
and Isaac his son, and clave the wood
for the burnt offering, and rose up,
and went unto the place of which God
had told him. Then on the third day
Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw
the place afar off. And Abraham
said unto his young men, Abide ye
here with the ass; and I and the lad
will go yonder and worship, and come
again to you.</p>

<p>And Abraham took the wood of the
burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac
his son; and he took the fire in his
hand, and a knife; and they went both
of them together. And Isaac spake
unto Abraham his father, and said,
My father: and he said, Here am I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
my son. And he said, Behold the fire
and the wood: but where is the lamb
for a burnt offering?</p>


<p>And Abraham said, My son, God
will provide himself a lamb for a
burnt offering: so they went both of
them together.</p>

<p>And they came to the place which
God had told him of; and Abraham
built an altar there, and laid the wood
in order, and bound Isaac his son,
and laid him on the altar upon the
wood.</p>

<p>And Abraham stretched forth his
hand, and took the knife to slay his
son.</p>

<p>And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> called
unto him out of heaven, and said,
Abraham, Abraham: and he said,
Here am I. And he said, Lay not
thine hand upon the lad, neither do
thou any thing unto him: for now
I know that thou fearest God, seeing
thou hast not withheld thy son, thine
only son from me.</p>

<p>And Abraham lifted up his eyes,
and looked, and behold behind him a
ram caught in a thicket by his horns:
and Abraham went and took the ram,
and offered him up for a burnt offering
in the stead of his son. And
Abraham called the name of that
place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to
this day, In the mount of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
it shall be seen.</p>

<p>And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> called
unto Abraham out of heaven the second

<small>THE DEATH AND BURIAL OF
SARAH</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 23</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Sarah was an hundred and
seven and twenty years old:
these were the years of the
life of Sarah. And Sarah died in
Hebron in the land of Canaan: and
Abraham came to mourn for Sarah,
and to weep for her.</div>

<p>And Abraham stood up from before
his dead, and spake unto the sons
of Heth, saying, I am a stranger and
a sojourner with you: give me a possession
of a buryingplace with you,
that I may bury my dead out of my
sight.</p>

<p>And the children of Heth answered
Abraham, saying unto him, Hear us,
my lord: thou art a mighty prince
among us: in the choice of our sepulchres
bury thy dead; none of us shall
withhold from thee his sepulchre, but
that thou mayest bury thy dead.</p>

<p>And Abraham stood up, and bowed
himself to the people of the land, even
to the children of Heth. And he communed
with them, saying, If it be
your mind that I should bury my
dead out of my sight; hear me, and
intreat for me to Ephron the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Zohar, that he may give me the cave
of Machpelah, which he hath, which
is in the end of his field; for as much
money as it is worth he shall give it
me for a possession of a buryingplace
amongst you. And Ephron dwelt
among the children of Heth: and
Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham,
saying, Nay, my lord, hear me:
the field give I thee, and the cave
that is therein, I give it thee; in the
presence of the sons of my people
give I it thee: bury thy dead.</p>

<p>And Abraham bowed down himself
before the people of the land. And
he spake unto Ephron, saying, But
if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear
me: I will give thee money for the
field; take it of me, and I will bury
my dead there.</p>

<p>And Ephron answered Abraham,
saying unto him, My lord, hearken
unto me: the land is worth four hundred
shekels of silver; what is that
betwixt me and thee? bury therefore
thy dead. And Abraham hearkened
unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed
to Ephron the silver, which he had
named in the audience of the sons
of Heth, four hundred shekels of
silver.</p>

<p>And the field of Ephron, which
was in Machpelah, which was before
Mamre, the field, and the cave which
was therein, and all the trees that
were in the field, that were in all the
borders round about, were made sure
unto Abraham for a possession in the
presence of the children of Heth, before
all that went in at the gate of
his city.</p>

<p>And after this, Abraham buried
Sarah his wife in the cave of the field
of Machpelah before Mamre: the

<small>HOW REBEKAH BECAME ISAAC'S
WIFE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Genesis 24</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Abraham was old, and
well stricken in age: and the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> had blessed Abraham
in all things. And Abraham said
unto his eldest servant of his house,
that ruled over all that he had, Put,
I pray thee, thy hand under my
thigh: and I will make thee swear by
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, and the
God of the earth, that thou shalt not
take a wife unto my son of the daughters
of the Canaanites, among whom
I dwell: but thou shalt go unto my
country, and to my kindred, and take
a wife unto my son Isaac.</div>

<p>And the servant said unto him,
Peradventure the woman will not be
willing to follow me unto this land:
must I needs bring thy son again
unto the land from whence thou camest?
And Abraham said unto him,
Beware thou that thou bring not my
son thither again. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God
of heaven, which took me from my
father's house, and from the land
of my kindred, and which spake unto
me, and that sware unto me, saying,
Unto thy seed will I give this land;
he shall send his angel before thee,
and thou shalt take a wife unto my
son from thence. And if the woman
will not be willing to follow thee, then
thou shalt be clear from this my oath:
only bring not my son thither again.
And the servant put his hand under
the thigh of Abraham his master, and
sware to him concerning that matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>And the servant took ten camels of
the camels of his master, and departed;
for all the goods of his master
were in his hand: and he arose, and
went to Mesopotamia, unto the city
of Nahor. And he made his camels
to kneel down without the city by a
well of water at the time of the evening,
even the time that women go
out to draw water. And he said, O
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of my master Abraham, I
pray thee, send me good speed this
day, and shew kindness unto my master
Abraham. Behold, I stand here
by the well of water; and the daughters
of the men of the city come out to
draw water: and let it come to pass,
that the damsel to whom I shall say,
Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee,
that I may drink; and she shall say,
Drink, and I will give thy camels
drink also: let the same be she that
thou hast appointed for thy servant
Isaac; and thereby shall I know that
thou hast shewed kindness unto my
master.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, before he had
done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah
came out, who was born to Bethuel,
son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor,
Abraham's brother, with her pitcher
upon her shoulder. And the damsel
was very fair to look upon: and she
went down to the well, and filled her
pitcher, and came up. And the servant
ran to meet her, and said, Let
me, I pray thee, drink a little water
of thy pitcher.</p>

<p>And she said, Drink, my lord: and
she hasted, and let down her pitcher
upon her hand, and gave him drink.
And when she had done giving him
drink, she said, I will draw water for
thy camels also, until they have done
drinking. And she hasted, and emptied
her pitcher into the trough, and
ran again unto the well to draw water,
and drew for all his camels. And the
man wondering at her held his peace,
to wit whether the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had made his
journey prosperous or not.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, as the camels
had done drinking, that the man took
a golden earring of half a shekel
weight, and two bracelets for her
hands of ten shekels weight of gold;
and said, Whose daughter art thou?
tell me, I pray thee: is there room in
thy father's house for us to lodge
in?</p>

<p>And she said unto him, I am the
daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah,
which she bare unto Nahor. She
said moreover unto him, We have
both straw and provender enough,
and room to lodge in. And the man
bowed down his head, and worshipped
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>And he said, Blessed be the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
God of my master Abraham, who
hath not left destitute my master of
his mercy and his truth: I being in
the way, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> led me to the house
of my master's brethren. And the
damsel ran, and told them of her
mother's house these things. And
Rebekah had a brother, and his name
was Laban: and Laban ran out unto
the man, unto the well. And it came
to pass, when he saw the earring and
bracelets upon his sister's hands, and
when he heard the words of Rebekah
his sister, saying, Thus spake the
man unto me; that he came unto the
man; and, behold, he stood by the
camels at the well. And he said,
Come in, thou blessed of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>;
wherefore standest thou without? for
I have prepared the house, and room
for the camels.</p>

and he ungirded his camels, and gave
straw and provender for the camels,
and water to wash his feet, and the
men's feet that were with him. And
there was set meat before him to eat:
but he said, I will not eat, until I have
told mine errand. And he said,
Speak on.</p>

<p>And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath blessed my
master greatly; and he is become
great: and he hath given him flocks,
and herds, and silver, and gold, and
menservants, and maidservants, and
camels, and asses. And Sarah my
master's wife bare a son to my master
when she was old: and unto him
hath he given all that he hath. And
my master made me swear, saying,
Thou shalt not take a wife to my son
of the daughters of the Canaanites,
in whose land I dwell: but thou shalt
go unto my father's house, and to my
kindred, and take a wife unto my son.
And I said unto my master, Peradventure
the woman will not follow
me. And he said unto me, The
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, before whom I walk, will send
his angel with thee, and prosper thy
way; and thou shalt take a wife for
my son of my kindred, and of my
father's house: then shalt thou be
clear from this my oath, when thou
comest to my kindred; and if they
give not thee one, thou shalt be clear
from my oath. And I came this day
unto the well, and said, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God
of my master Abraham, if now thou
do prosper my way which I go: behold,
I stand by the well of water;
and it shall come to pass, that when
the virgin cometh forth to draw water,
and I say to her, Give me, I pray
thee, a little water of thy pitcher
to drink; and she say to me, Both
drink thou, and I will also draw for
thy camels: let the same be the woman
whom the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath appointed
out for my master's son. And before
I had done speaking in mine
heart, behold, Rebekah came forth
with her pitcher on her shoulder; and
she went down unto the well, and
drew water: and I said unto her,
Let me drink, I pray thee. And she
made haste, and let down her pitcher
from her shoulder, and said, Drink,
and I will give thy camels drink also:
so I drank, and she made the camels
drink also. And I asked her, and
said, Whose daughter art thou? And
she said, The daughter of Bethuel,
Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto
him: and I put the earring upon her
face, and the bracelets upon her
hands. And I bowed down my head,
and worshipped the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and blessed
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of my master Abraham,
which had led me in the right way
to take my master's brother's daughter
unto his son. And now if ye will
deal kindly and truly with my master,
tell me: and if not, tell me; that I
may turn to the right hand, or to the
left.</p>

<p>Then Laban and Bethuel answered
and said, The thing proceedeth from
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: we cannot speak unto thee
bad or good. Behold, Rebekah is before
thee, take her, and go, and let
her be thy master's son's wife, as the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath spoken.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, that, when
Abraham's servant heard their words,
he worshipped the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, bowing himself
to the earth. And the servant
brought forth jewels of silver, and
jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave
them to Rebekah: he gave also to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
brother and to her mother precious
things. And they did eat and drink,
he and the men that were with him,
and tarried all night; and they rose
up in the morning, and he said,
Send me away unto my master. And
her brother and her mother said, Let
the damsel abide with us a few days,
at the least ten; after that she shall
go. And he said unto them, Hinder
me not, seeing the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath prospered
my way; send me away that
I may go to my master. And they
said, We will call the damsel, and enquire
at her mouth. And they called
Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt
thou go with this man? And she said,
I will go.</p>

<p>And they sent away Rebekah their
sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's
servant, and his men. And they
blessed Rebekah, and said unto her,
Thou art our sister, be thou the
mother of thousands of millions, and
let thy seed possess the gate of those
which hate them.</p>

<p>And Rebekah arose, and her damsels,
and they rode upon the camels,
and followed the man: and the servant
took Rebekah, and went his way.</p>

<p>And Isaac came from the way of the
well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the
south country. And Isaac went out
to meditate in the field at the eventide:
and he lifted up his eyes, and
saw, and, behold, the camels were
coming.</p>

<p>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes,
and when she saw Isaac, she lighted
off the camel. For she had said unto
the servant, What man is this that
walketh in the field to meet us? And
the servant had said, It is my master:
therefore she took a vail, and covered
herself.</p>

<p>And the servant told Isaac all
things that he had done.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Genesis 25</div>
<p>And Abraham lived an hundred
threescore and fifteen years. Then

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="150" height="173" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">AND Isaac was forty
years old when
he took Rebekah
to wife: and Rebekah
bare twins.
And the first was
red, all over like
an hairy garment;
and they
called his name Esau; and his brother
was called Jacob.</div>

<p>And the boys grew: and Esau was
a cunning hunter, a man of the field;
and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling
in tents. And Isaac loved Esau, because
he did eat of his venison: but
Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>

<p>And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau
came from the field, and he was faint:
and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me,
I pray thee, with that same red pottage;
for I am faint: therefore was
his name called Edom. And Jacob
said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
And Esau said, Behold, I am at the
point to die: and what profit shall
this birthright do to me? And Jacob
said, Swear to me this day; and he
sware unto him: and he sold his birthright
unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave
Esau bread and pottage of lentiles;
and he did eat and drink, and rose
up, and went his way: thus Esau despised
his birthright.</p>

<p>And there was a famine in the land,
beside the first famine that was in
the days of Abraham. And Isaac
went unto Abimelech king of the
Philistines unto Gerar.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared unto him,
and said, Go not down into Egypt;
dwell in the land which I shall tell
thee of: sojourn in this land, and I
will be with thee, and will bless thee;
for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I
will give all these countries, and I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
perform the oath which I sware unto
Abraham thy father; and I will make
thy seed to multiply as the stars of
heaven, and will give unto thy seed
all these countries; and in thy seed
shall all the nations of the earth
be blessed; because that Abraham
obeyed my voice, and kept my charge,
my commandments, my statutes, and
my laws.</p>

<p>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and
received in the same year an hundredfold:
and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> blessed him.
And the man waxed great, and went
forward, and grew until he became
very great: for he had possession of
flocks, and possession of herds, and
great store of servants: and the Philistines
envied him. For all the wells
which his father's servants had
digged in the days of Abraham his
father, the Philistines had stopped
them, and filled them with earth.</p>

<p>And Abimelech said unto Isaac,
Go from us; for thou art much mightier
than we. And Isaac departed
thence, and pitched his tent in the
valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
And Isaac digged again the wells of
water, which they had digged in the
days of Abraham his father; for the
Philistines had stopped them after
the death of Abraham: and he called
their names after the names by which
his father had called them. And
Isaac's servants digged in the valley,
and found there a well of springing
water.</p>

<p>And the herdmen of Gerar did
strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying,
The water is our's: and he called
the name of the well Esek; because
they strove with him. And they
digged another well, and strove for
that also: and he called the name
of it Sitnah. And he removed from
thence, and digged another well;
and for that they strove not: and
he called the name of it Rehoboth;
and he said, For now the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath
made room for us, and we shall be
fruitful in the land. And he went
up from thence to Beer-sheba. And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared unto him the same
night, and said, I am the God of
Abraham thy father: fear not, for
I am with thee, and will bless thee,
and multiply thy seed for my servant
Abraham's sake. And he builded an
altar there, and called upon the name
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and pitched his tent
there: and there Isaac's servants
digged a well.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, that Isaac's
servants came, and told him concerning
the well which they had digged,
and said unto him, We have found
water. And he called it Shebah:
therefore the name of the city is
Beer-sheba unto this day.</p>

<p>And Esau was forty years old
when he took to wife Judith the
daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and
Bashemath the daughter of Elon the
Hittite: which were a grief of mind
unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 27</div>


<p>And it came to pass, that when
Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim,
so that he could not see, he called
Esau his eldest son, and said unto
him, My son: and he said unto him,
Behold, here am I. And he said,
Behold now, I am old, I know not the
day of my death: now therefore take,
I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver
and thy bow, and go out to the field,
and take me some venison; and make
me savoury meat, such as I love, and
bring it to me, that I may eat; that
my soul may bless thee before I die.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
And Rebekah heard when Isaac
spake to Esau his son. And Esau
went to the field to hunt for venison,
and to bring it.</p>

<p>And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her
son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father
speak unto Esau thy brother,
saying, Bring me venison, and make
me savoury meat, that I may eat, and
bless thee before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> before my
death. Now therefore, my son, obey
my voice according to that which I
command thee. Go now to the flock,
and fetch me from thence two good
kids of the goats; and I will make
them savoury meat for thy father,
such as he loveth: and thou shalt
bring it to thy father, that he may
eat, and that he may bless thee before
his death.</p>

<p>And Jacob said to Rebekah his
mother, Behold, Esau my brother is
a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:
my father peradventure will feel me,
and I shall seem to him as a deceiver;
and I shall bring a curse upon me,
and not a blessing. And his mother
said unto him, Upon me be thy curse,
my son: only obey my voice, and go
fetch me them.</p>

<p>And he went, and fetched, and
brought them to his mother: and his
mother made savoury meat, such as
his father loved. And Rebekah took
goodly raiment of her eldest son
Esau, which were with her in the
house, and put them upon Jacob her
younger son: and she put the skins
of the kids of the goats upon his
hands, and upon the smooth of his
neck: and she gave the savoury meat
and the bread, which she had prepared,
into the hand of her son
Jacob.</p>

<p>And he came unto his father, and
said, My father: and he said, Here
am I; who art thou, my son? And
Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau
thy firstborn; I have done according
as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee,
sit and eat of my venison, that thy
soul may bless me. And Isaac said
unto his son, How is it that thou hast
found it so quickly, my son? And
he said, Because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God
brought it to me. And Isaac said unto
Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I
may feel thee, my son, whether thou
be my very son Esau or not. And
Jacob went near unto Isaac his father;
and he felt him, and said, The
voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands
are the hands of Esau. And he discerned
him not, because his hands
were hairy, as his brother Esau's
hands: so he blessed him. And he
said, Art thou my very son Esau?
And he said, I am. And he said,
Bring it near to me, and I will eat of
my son's venison, that my soul may
bless thee. And he brought it near
to him, and he did eat: and he
brought him wine, and he drank.
And his father Isaac said unto him,
Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
And he came near, and kissed him:
and he smelled the smell of his raiment,
and blessed him, and said, See,
the smell of my son is as the smell of
a field which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath blessed:
therefore God give thee of the dew
of heaven, and the fatness of the
earth, and plenty of corn and wine:
let people serve thee, and nations
bow down to thee: be lord over thy
brethren, and let thy mother's sons
bow down to thee: cursed be every
one that curseth thee, and blessed be
he that blesseth thee. And it came
to pass, as soon as Isaac had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob
was yet scarce gone out from the
presence of Isaac his father, that
Esau his brother came in from his
hunting.</p>

<p>And he also had made savoury
meat, and brought it unto his father,
and said unto his father, Let my father
arise, and eat of his son's venison,
that thy soul may bless me.
And Isaac his father said unto him,
Who art thou? And he said, I am
thy son, thy firstborn Esau. And
Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and
said, Who? where is he that hath
taken venison, and brought it me, and
I have eaten of all before thou camest,
and have blessed him? yea, and
he shall be blessed. And when Esau
heard the words of his father, he
cried with a great and exceeding bitter
cry, and said unto his father,
Bless me, even me also, O my father.
And he said, Thy brother came with
subtilty, and hath taken away thy
blessing. And he said, Is not he
rightly named Jacob? for he hath
supplanted me these two times: he
took away my birthright; and, behold,
now he hath taken away my
blessing. And he said, Hast thou not
reserved a blessing for me? And
Isaac answered and said unto Esau,
Behold, I have made him thy lord,
and all his brethren have I given to
him for servants; and with corn and
wine have I sustained him: and what
shall I do now unto thee, my son?</p>

<p>And Esau said unto his father,
Hast thou but one blessing, my father?
bless me, even me also, O my
father. And Esau lifted up his voice,
and wept.</p>

<p>And Isaac his father answered and
said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling
shall be the fatness of the earth, and
of the dew of heaven from above;
and by thy sword shalt thou live, and
shalt serve thy brother; and it shall
come to pass when thou shalt have
the dominion, that thou shalt break
his yoke from off thy neck. And
Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing
wherewith his father blessed him:
and Esau said in his heart, The
days of mourning for my father are
at hand; then will I slay my brother
Jacob. And these words of Esau
her elder son were told to Rebekah:
and she sent and called Jacob her
younger son, and said unto him, Behold,
thy brother Esau, as touching
thee, doth comfort himself, purposing
to kill thee. Now therefore, my
son, obey my voice; and arise, flee
thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
and tarry with him a few days, until
thy brother's fury turn away; until
thy brother's anger turn away
from thee, and he forget that which
thou hast done to him: then I will
send, and fetch thee from thence:
why should I be deprived also of you
both in one day?</p>

<small>JACOB AND RACHEL</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 28</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND Isaac called Jacob, and
blessed him, and charged him,
and said unto him, Thou shalt
not take a wife of the daughters of
Canaan. Arise, go to Padan-aram,
to the house of Bethuel thy mother's
father; and take thee a wife from
thence of the daughters of Laban thy
mother's brother. And God Almighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and

<div class="caption">JACOB'S LADDER, BY MURILLO<br />
<span class='location'>IN THE HERMITAGE MUSEUM, ST. PETERSBURG</span></div>
</div>

<p>And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he
went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son
of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of
Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.</p>

<p>And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba,
and went toward Haran. And
he lighted upon a certain place, and
tarried there all night, because the
sun was set; and he took of the stones
of that place, and put them for his
pillows, and lay down in that place
to sleep. And he dreamed, and behold
a ladder set up on the earth,
and the top of it reached to heaven:
and behold the angels of God ascending
and descending on it. And, behold,
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> stood above it, and
said, I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Abraham
thy father, and the God of Isaac:
the land whereon thou liest, to thee
will I give it, and to thy seed; and
thy seed shall be as the dust of the
earth, and thou shalt spread abroad
to the west, and to the east, and to the
north, and to the south: and in thee
and in thy seed shall all the families
of the earth be blessed.</p>

<p>And, behold, I am with thee, and
will keep thee in all places whither
thou goest, and will bring thee again
into this land; for I will not leave
thee, until I have done that which I
have spoken to thee of. And Jacob
awaked out of his sleep, and he said,
Surely the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is in this place;
and I knew it not. And he was
afraid, and said, How dreadful is this
place! this is none other but the house
of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 29</div>

<p>And Jacob rose up early in the
morning, and took the stone that he
had put for his pillows, and set it up
for a pillar, and poured oil upon the
top of it. And he called the name
of that place Beth-el. And Jacob
vowed a vow, saying, If God will be
with me, and will keep me in this way
that I go, and will give me bread to
eat, and raiment to put on, so that I
come again to my father's house in
peace; then shall the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> be my
God: and this stone, which I have
set for a pillar, shall be God's house:
and of all that thou shalt give me I
will surely give the tenth unto thee.
Then Jacob went on his journey, and
came into the land of the people of
the east. And he looked, and behold
a well in the field, and, lo, there were
three flocks of sheep lying by it; for
out of that well they watered the
flocks: and a great stone was upon the
well's mouth. And thither were all
the flocks gathered: and they rolled
the stone from the well's mouth, and
watered the sheep, and put the stone
again upon the well's mouth in his
place.</p>

<p>And Jacob said unto them, My
brethren, whence be ye? And they
said, Of Haran are we. And he said
unto them, Know ye Laban the son
of Nahor? And they said, We know
him. And he said unto them, Is he
well? And they said, He is well: and,
behold, Rachel his daughter cometh
with the sheep. And he said, Lo, it
is yet high day, neither is it time that
the cattle should be gathered together:
water ye the sheep, and go and
feed them. And they said, We cannot,
until all the flocks be gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
together, and till they roll the stone
from the well's mouth; then we water
the sheep.</p>

<p>And while he yet spake with them,
Rachel came with her father's sheep:
for she kept them. And it came to
pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the
daughter of Laban his mother's
brother, and the sheep of Laban his
mother's brother, that Jacob went
near, and rolled the stone from the
well's mouth, and watered the flock
of Laban his mother's brother. And
Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up
his voice, and wept. And Jacob told
Rachel that he was her father's
brother, and that he was Rebekah's
son: and she ran and told her father.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Laban
heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's
son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced
him, and kissed him, and
brought him to his house. And
he told Laban all these things. And
Laban said to him, Surely thou
art my bone and my flesh. And
he abode with him the space of a
month.</p>

<p>And Laban said unto Jacob, Because
thou art my brother, shouldest
thou therefore serve me for nought?
tell me, what shall thy wages be?
And Laban had two daughters: the
name of the elder was Leah, and the
name of the younger was Rachel.
Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was
beautiful and well favoured. And
Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will
serve thee seven years for Rachel
thy younger daughter. And Laban
said, It is better that I give her to
thee, than that I should give her to
another man: abide with me. And
Jacob served seven years for Rachel;
and they seemed unto him but
a few days, for the love he had to
her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 30</div>

<p>And Jacob said unto Laban, Give
me my wife, for my days are fulfilled.
And Laban gathered together
all the men of the place, and
made a feast. And it came to pass
in the evening, that he took Leah his
daughter, and brought her to him.
And it came to pass, that in the morning
he said to Laban, What is this
thou hast done unto me? did not I
serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore
then hast thou beguiled me?
And Laban said, It must not be so
done in our country, to give the
younger before the firstborn. We will
give thee Rachel also for the service
which thou shalt serve with me yet
seven other years. And Jacob did
so: and he gave him Rachel his
daughter to wife also. And Jacob
loved also Rachel more than Leah.
And Leah had four sons, Reuben,
Simeon, Levi, and Judah. And Rachel
envied her sister, and said, Give
me children, or else I die. And Jacob
was angry with her, and said,
Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld
children from thee? And she
gave him her maid Bilhah to wife:
and Bilhah bare Jacob Dan and
Naphtali. Then Leah gave Zilpah
her maid to Jacob to wife: and she
bare him two sons, Gad and Asher.
And Leah bare Issachar and Zebulun,
and a daughter whom she called
Dinah.</p>

<p>And God remembered Rachel, and
God hearkened to her. And she bare
a son; and said, God hath taken away
my reproach: and she called his
name Joseph; and said, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shall add to me another son.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_16" id="CHAPTER_16">CHAPTER 16</a><br />

<small>JACOB AND LABAN</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 30</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, when Rachel
had born Joseph, that
Jacob said unto Laban, Send
me away, that I may go unto mine
own place, and to my country. Give
me my wives and my children, for
whom I have served thee, and let me
go: for thou knowest my service
which I have done thee.</div>

<p>And Laban said unto him, I pray
thee, if I have found favour in thine
eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath blessed
me for thy sake. And he said, Appoint
me thy wages, and I will give
it. And he said unto him, Thou
knowest how I have served thee, and
how thy cattle was with me. For it
was little which thou hadst before I
came, and it is now increased unto a
multitude; and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath blessed
thee since my coming: and now when
shall I provide for mine own house
also? And he said, What shall I
give thee? And Jacob said, Thou
shalt not give me any thing: if thou
wilt do this thing for me, I will again
feed and keep thy flock. I will
pass through all thy flock to day, removing
from thence all the speckled
and spotted cattle, and all the brown
cattle among the sheep, and the spotted
and speckled among the goats:
and of such shall be my hire. So
shall my righteousness answer for me
in time to come, when it shall come
for my hire before thy face: every
one that is not speckled and spotted
among the goats, and brown among
the sheep, that shall be counted stolen
with me. And Laban said, Behold,
I would it might be according to thy
word. And he removed that day the
he goats that were ringstraked and
spotted, and all the she goats that
were speckled and spotted, and every
one that had some white in it, and
all the brown among the sheep, and
gave them into the hand of his sons.</p>

<p>And he set three days' journey betwixt
himself and Jacob: and Jacob
fed the rest of Laban's flocks. And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> caused the stronger cattle
to bear cattle ringstraked, speckled,
and spotted, and the feebler to bear
brown cattle: so the feebler were
Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
And the man increased exceedingly,
and had much cattle, and maidservants,
and menservants, and camels,
and asses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 31</div>


<p>And he heard the words of Laban's
sons, saying, Jacob hath taken
away all that was our father's; and of
that which was our father's hath he
gotten all this glory. And Jacob
beheld the countenance of Laban,
and, behold, it was not toward him as
before. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Jacob,
Return unto the land of thy
fathers, and to thy kindred; and I
will be with thee.</p>

<p>And Jacob sent and called Rachel
and Leah to the field unto his flock,
and said unto them, I see your father's
countenance, that it is not toward
me as before; but the God of my
father hath been with me. And ye
know that with all my power I have
served your father.</p>

<p>And your father hath deceived me,
and changed my wages ten times;
but God suffered him not to hurt me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
If he said thus, The speckled shall
be thy wages; then all the cattle bare
speckled: and if he said thus, The
ringstraked shall be thy hire; then
bare all the cattle ringstraked. Thus
God hath taken away the cattle of
your father, and given them to me.</p>

<p>And Rachel and Leah answered
and said unto him, Is there yet any
portion or inheritance for us in our
father's house? are we not counted
of him strangers? for he hath sold us,
and hath quite devoured also our
money. For all the riches which
God hath taken from our father, that
is our's, and our children's: now
then, whatsoever God hath said unto
thee, do.</p>

<p>Then Jacob rose up, and set his
sons and his wives upon camels; and
he carried away all his cattle, and all
his goods, for to go to Isaac his
father in the land of Canaan. And
Laban went to shear his sheep: and
Rachel had stolen the images that
were her father's. And Jacob stole
away unawares to Laban the Syrian,
in that he told him not that he fled.
So he fled with all that he had; and he
rose up, and passed over the river,
and set his face toward the mount
Gilead.</p>

<p>And it was told Laban on the third
day that Jacob was fled. And he
took his brethren with him, and pursued
after him seven days' journey;
and they overtook him in the mount
Gilead. And God came to Laban the
Syrian in a dream by night, and said
unto him, Take heed that thou speak
not to Jacob either good or bad.</p>

<p>Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now
Jacob had pitched his tent in the
mount: and Laban with his brethren
pitched in the mount of Gilead. And
Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou
done, that thou hast stolen away unawares
to me, and carried away my
daughters, as captives taken with
the sword? Wherefore didst thou
flee away secretly, and steal away
from me; and didst not tell me, that
I might have sent thee away with
mirth, and with songs, with tabret,
and with harp? and hast not suffered
me to kiss my sons and my
daughters? thou hast now done foolishly
in so doing. It is in the power
of my hand to do you hurt: but the
God of your father spake unto me
yesternight, saying, Take thou heed
that thou speak not to Jacob either
good or bad. And now, though thou
wouldest needs be gone, because thou
sore longedst after thy father's house,
yet wherefore hast thou stolen my
gods?</p>

<p>And Jacob answered and said to
Laban, Because I was afraid: for
I said, Peradventure thou wouldest
take by force thy daughters from
me. With whomsoever thou findest
thy gods, let him not live: before our
brethren discern thou what is thine
with me, and take it to thee. For
Jacob knew not that Rachel had
stolen them. And Laban searched,
but found not the images. And Jacob
was wroth, and chode with Laban:
and Jacob answered and said
to Laban, What is my trespass? what
is my sin, that thou hast so hotly
pursued after me? Whereas thou
hast searched all my stuff, what hast
thou found of all thy household stuff?
set it here before my brethren and
thy brethren, that they may judge
betwixt us both. This twenty years
have I been with thee; thy ewes and
thy she goats have not cast their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
young, and the rams of thy flock have
I not eaten. That which was torn of
beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare
the loss of it; of my hand didst thou
require it, whether stolen by day, or
stolen by night. Thus I was; in the
day the drought consumed me, and
the frost by night; and my sleep departed
from mine eyes. Thus have
I been twenty years in thy house;
I served thee fourteen years for thy
two daughters, and six years for thy
cattle: and thou hast changed my
wages ten times. Except the God of
my father, the God of Abraham, and
the fear of Isaac, had been with me,
surely thou hadst sent me away now
empty. God hath seen mine affliction
and the labour of my hands, and rebuked
thee yesternight.</p>

<p>And Laban answered and said
unto Jacob, These daughters are my
daughters, and these children are my
children, and these cattle are my cattle,
and all that thou seest is mine:
and what can I do this day unto these
my daughters, or unto their children
which they have born? Now therefore
come thou, let us make a covenant,
I and thou; and let it be for a
witness between me and thee. And
Jacob took a stone, and set it up for
a pillar. And Jacob said unto his
brethren, Gather stones; and they
took stones, and made an heap: and
they did eat there upon the heap.
And Laban said, This heap is a witness
between me and thee this day.
Therefore was the name of it called
Galeed; and Mizpah; for he said,
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> watch between me and
thee, when we are absent one from
another. If thou shalt afflict my
daughters, or if thou shalt take other
wives beside my daughters, no man
is with us; see, God is witness betwixt
me and thee. And Laban said
to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold
this pillar, which I have cast
betwixt me and thee; this heap be
witness, and this pillar be witness,
that I will not pass over this heap to
thee, and that thou shalt not pass
over this heap and this pillar unto me,
for harm. The God of Abraham, and
the God of Nahor, the God of their
father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob
sware by the fear of his father Isaac.</p>

<p>Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon
the mount, and called his brethren
to eat bread: and they did eat bread,
and tarried all night in the mount.
And early in the morning Laban rose
up, and kissed his sons and his
daughters, and blessed them: and Laban
departed, and returned unto his
place.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_17" id="CHAPTER_17">CHAPTER 17</a><br />

<small>MEETING OF JACOB AND ESAU</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 32</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND Jacob went on his way, and
the angels of God met him.
And when Jacob saw them, he
said, This is God's host: and he called
the name of that place Mahanaim.</div>

<p>And Jacob sent messengers before
him to Esau his brother unto the land
of Seir, the country of Edom. And
he commanded them, saying, Thus
shall ye speak unto my lord Esau;
Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have
sojourned with Laban, and stayed
there until now: and I have oxen,
and asses, flocks, and menservants,
and womenservants: and I have sent
to tell my lord, that I may find grace
in thy sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>


<p>And the messengers returned to Jacob,
saying, We came to thy brother
Esau, and also he cometh to meet
thee, and four hundred men with
him. Then Jacob was greatly afraid
and distressed: and he divided the
people that was with him, and the
flocks, and herds, and the camels, into
two bands; and said, If Esau come
to the one company, and smite it, then
the other company which is left shall
escape.</p>

<p>And Jacob said, O God of my father
Abraham, and God of my father
Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto
me, Return unto thy country, and to
thy kindred, and I will deal well with
thee: I am not worthy of the least of
all the mercies, and of all the truth,
which thou hast shewed unto thy servant;
for with my staff I passed over
this Jordan; and now I am become
two bands. Deliver me, I pray thee,
from the hand of my brother, from
the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest
he will come and smite me, and the
mother with the children. And thou
saidst, I will surely do thee good, and
make thy seed as the sand of the sea,
which cannot be numbered for multitude.</p>

<p>And he lodged there that same
night; and took of that which came
to his hand a present for Esau his
brother; two hundred she goats, and
twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,
and twenty rams, thirty milch camels
with their colts, forty kine, and ten
bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
And he delivered them into the hand
of his servants, every drove by themselves;
and said unto his servants,
Pass over before me, and put a space
betwixt drove and drove.</p>

<p>And he commanded the foremost,
saying, When Esau my brother meeteth
thee, and asketh thee, saying,
Whose art thou? and whither goest
thou? and whose are these before
thee? Then thou shalt say, They be
thy servant Jacob's; it is a present
sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold,
also he is behind us. And so commanded
he the second, and the third,
and all that followed the droves, saying,
On this manner shall ye speak
unto Esau, when ye find him. And
say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant
Jacob is behind us. For he said,
I will appease him with the present
that goeth before me, and afterward
I will see his face; peradventure he
will accept of me. So went the present
over before him: and himself
lodged that night in the company.
And he rose up that night, and took
his two wives, and his two womenservants,
and his eleven sons, and
passed over the ford Jabbok. And he
took them, and sent them over the
brook, and sent over that he had.</p>

<p>And Jacob was left alone; and
there wrestled a man with him until
the breaking of the day. And when he
saw that he prevailed not against him,
he touched the hollow of his thigh;
and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
And he said, Let me go, for the day
breaketh. And he said, I will not let
thee go, except thou bless me. And
he said unto him, What is thy name?
And he said, Jacob. And he said,
Thy name shall be called no more
Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince
hast thou power with God and with
men, and hast prevailed. And Jacob
asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray
thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore
is it that thou dost ask after my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
name? And he blessed him there.
And Jacob called the name of the
place Peniel: for I have seen God
face to face, and my life is preserved.
And as he passed over Penuel the sun
rose upon him, and he halted upon his
thigh. Therefore the children of
Israel eat not of the sinew which
shrank, which is upon the hollow of
the thigh, unto this day: because he
touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh
in the sinew that shrank.</p>

<p>And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and
looked, and, behold, Esau came, and
with him four hundred men. And he
divided the children unto Leah, and
unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
And he put the handmaids
and their children foremost, and
Leah and her children after, and Rachel
and Joseph hindermost.</p>

<p>And he passed over before them,
and bowed himself to the ground
seven times, until he came near to his
brother. And Esau ran to meet him,
and embraced him, and fell on his
neck, and kissed him: and they wept.</p>

<p>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw
the women and the children; and
said, Who are those with thee? And
he said, The children which God hath
graciously given thy servant. Then
the handmaidens came near, they and
their children, and they bowed themselves.
And Leah also with her children
came near, and bowed themselves:
and after came Joseph near
and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
And he said, What meanest
thou by all this drove which I met?
And he said, These are to find grace
in the sight of my lord. And Esau
said, I have enough, my brother;
keep that thou hast unto thyself.
And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee,
if now I have found grace in thy
sight, then receive my present at my
hand: for therefore I have seen thy
face, as though I had seen the face of
God, and thou wast pleased with me.
Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is
brought to thee; because God hath
dealt graciously with me, and because
I have enough. And he urged him,
and he took it.</p>

<p>And he said, Let us take our journey,
and let us go, and I will go before
thee. And he said unto him,
My lord knoweth that the children
are tender, and the flocks and herds
are with me: and if men should over-drive
them one day, all the flock will
die. Let my lord, I pray thee, pass
over before his servant: and I will
lead on softly, according as the cattle
that goeth before me and the children
be able to endure, until I come unto
my lord unto Seir. And Esau said,
Let me now leave with thee some of
the folk that are with me. And he
said, What needeth it? let me find
grace in the sight of my lord. So
Esau returned that day on his way
unto Seir. And Jacob journeyed to
Succoth, and built him an house, and
made booths for his cattle. And Jacob
came to Shalem, a city of Shechem,
which is in the land of Canaan,
when he came from Padan-aram; and
pitched his tent before the city.</p>

<small>THE BIRTH OF BENJAMIN</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 35</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND God said unto Jacob, Arise,
go up to Beth-el, and dwell
there: and make there an altar
unto God, that appeared unto thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
when thou fleddest from the face of
Esau thy brother.</div>

<p>Then Jacob said unto his household,
and to all that were with him,
Put away the strange gods that are
among you, and be clean, and change
your garments: and let us arise, and
go up to Beth-el; and I will make
there an altar unto God, who answered
me in the day of my distress,
and was with me in the way which I
went. And they gave unto Jacob all
the strange gods which were in their
hand, and all their earrings which
were in their ears; and Jacob hid
them under the oak which was by
Shechem. And they journeyed: and
the terror of God was upon the cities
that were round about them, and they
did not pursue after the sons of
Jacob.</p>

<p>So Jacob came to Luz, which is in
the land of Canaan, that is, Beth-el,
he and all the people that were with
him. And he built there an altar, and
called the place El-beth-el: because
there God appeared unto him, when
he fled from the face of his brother.
But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died,
and she was buried beneath Beth-el
under an oak. And God appeared
unto Jacob again, when he came out
of Padan-aram, and blessed him.
And God said unto him, Thy name
is Jacob: thy name shall not be called
any more Jacob, but Israel shall be
thy name: and he called his name
Israel. And God said unto him, I
am God Almighty: be fruitful and
multiply; a nation and a company of
nations shall be of thee, and kings
shall descend from thee; and the land
which I gave Abraham and Isaac,
to thee I will give it, and to thy seed
after thee will I give the land. And
God went up from him in the place
where he talked with him. And Jacob
set up a pillar in the place where
he talked with him, even a pillar of
stone: and he poured a drink offering
thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
And Jacob called the name of the
place where God spake with him,
Beth-el.</p>

<p>And they journeyed from Beth-el;
and there was but a little way to come
to Ephrath: and Rachel bare a son.
And it came to pass, as her soul was
in departing, (for she died) that she
called his name Ben-oni: but his father
called him Benjamin. And Rachel
died, and was buried in the way
to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem.
And Jacob set a pillar upon her
grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's
grave unto this day.</p>

<p>And Israel journeyed, and spread
his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</p>

<p>Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon,
and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar,
and Zebulun, and Dan, and
Naphtali, and Gad, and Asher, and
the sons of Rachel, Joseph and Benjamin.</p>

<p>And Jacob came unto Isaac his
father unto Mamre, unto the city
of Arbah, which is Hebron, where
Abraham and Isaac sojourned. And
the days of Isaac were an hundred
and fourscore years. And Isaac gave
up the ghost, and died, and was gathered
unto his people, being old and
full of days: and his sons Esau and
Jacob buried him. And Esau took
his wives, and his sons, and his
daughters, and all the persons of his
house, and his cattle, and all his
beasts, and all his substance, which
he had got in the land of Canaan;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and went into the country from the
face of his brother Jacob. For their
riches were more than that they
might dwell together; and the land
wherein they were strangers could
not bear them because of their cattle.
Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir:
Esau is Edom.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_19" id="CHAPTER_19">CHAPTER 19</a><br />

<small>JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 37</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND Jacob dwelt in the land
wherein his father was a
stranger, in the land of Canaan.
These are the generations of
Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years
old, was feeding the flock with his
brethren: and Joseph brought unto
his father their evil report. Now
Israel loved Joseph more than all his
children, because he was the son of
his old age: and he made him a coat
of many colours. And when his
brethren saw that their father loved
him more than all his brethren, they
hated him, and could not speak peaceably
unto him.</div>

<p>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and
he told it his brethren: and they
hated him yet the more. And he said
unto them, Hear, I pray you, this
dream which I have dreamed: for,
behold, we were binding sheaves in
the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and
also stood upright; and, behold, your
sheaves stood round about, and made
obeisance to my sheaf. And his
brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed
reign over us? or shalt thou
indeed have dominion over us? And
they hated him yet the more for his
dreams, and for his words.</p>

<p>And he dreamed yet another dream,
and told it his brethren, and said,
Behold, I have dreamed a dream
more; and, behold, the sun and the
moon and the eleven stars made obeisance
to me. And he told it to his
father, and to his brethren: and his
father rebuked him, and said unto
him, What is this dream that thou
hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother
and thy brethren indeed come to
bow down ourselves to thee to the
earth? And his brethren envied
him; but his father observed the
saying.</p>

<p>And his brethren went to feed their
father's flock in Shechem. And Israel
said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren
feed the flock in Shechem? come,
and I will send thee unto them. And
he said to him, Here am I. And he
said to him, Go, I pray thee, see
whether it be well with thy brethren,
and well with the flocks; and bring
me word again. So he sent him out
of the vale of Hebron, and he came
to Shechem.</p>

<p>And a certain man found him, and,
behold, he was wandering in the field:
and the man asked him, saying,
What seekest thou? And he said,
I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray
thee, where they feed their flocks.
And the man said, They are departed
hence; for I heard them say, Let us
go to Dothan. And Joseph went after
his brethren, and found them in
Dothan.</p>

<p>And when they saw him afar off,
even before he came near unto them,
they conspired against him to slay
him. And they said one to another,
Behold, this dreamer cometh. Come
now therefore, and let us slay him,
and cast him into some pit, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
will say, Some evil beast hath devoured
him: and we shall see what
will become of his dreams. And
Reuben heard it, and he delivered him
out of their hands; and said, Let us
not kill him. And Reuben said unto
them, Shed no blood, but cast him
into this pit that is in the wilderness,
and lay no hand upon him; that he
might rid him out of their hands, to
deliver him to his father again.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Joseph
was come unto his brethren, that they
stript Joseph out of his coat, his
coat of many colours that was on him;
and they took him, and cast him into
a pit: and the pit was empty, there
was no water in it. And they sat
down to eat bread: and they lifted up
their eyes and looked, and, behold,
a company of Ishmeelites came from
Gilead with their camels bearing
spicery and balm and myrrh, going to
carry it down to Egypt. And Judah
said unto his brethren, What profit
is it if we slay our brother, and conceal
his blood? Come, and let us sell
him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our
hand be upon him; for he is our brother
and our flesh. And his brethren
were content. Then there passed by
Midianites merchantmen; and they
drew and lifted up Joseph out of the
pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites
for twenty pieces of silver: and
they brought Joseph into Egypt.</p>

<p>And Reuben returned unto the pit;
and, behold, Joseph was not in the
pit; and he rent his clothes. And he
returned unto his brethren, and said,
The child is not; and I, whither shall
I go? And they took Joseph's coat,
and killed a kid of the goats, and
dipped the coat in the blood; and
they sent the coat of many colours,
and they brought it to their father;
and said, This have we found: know
now whether it be thy son's coat or
no.</p>

<p>And he knew it, and said, It is
my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured
him; Joseph is without doubt
rent in pieces. And Jacob rent his
clothes, and put sackcloth upon his
loins, and mourned for his son many
days. And all his sons and all his
daughters rose up to comfort him;
but he refused to be comforted; and
he said, For I will go down into the
grave unto my son mourning. Thus
his father wept for him.</p>

<p>And the Midianites sold him into
Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of
Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 39</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was with Joseph,
and he was a prosperous man; and
he was in the house of his master the
Egyptian. And his master saw that
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was with him, and that the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> made all that he did to prosper
in his hand. And Joseph found grace
in his sight, and he served him: and
he made him overseer over his house,
and all that he had he put into his
hand.</p>

<p>And it came to pass from the time
that he had made him overseer in his
house, and over all that he had, that
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> blessed the Egyptian's house
for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was upon all that he had in
the house, and in the field. And he
left all that he had in Joseph's hand;
and he knew not ought he had, save
the bread which he did eat. And Joseph
was a goodly person, and well
favoured. And it came to pass after
these things, that his master's wife
tempted Joseph to sin. But he refused,
and said unto his master's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
wife, Behold, my master wotteth not
what is with me in the house, and he
hath committed all that he hath to my
hand; there is none greater in this
house than I; neither hath he kept
back any thing from me: how then
can I do this great wickedness, and
sin against God? And it came to
pass, as she spake to Joseph day by
day, that he hearkened not unto her.
And she spake unto her lord according
to these words, saying, The
Hebrew servant, which thou hast
brought unto us, came in unto me to
mock me. And it came to pass, when
his master heard the words of his
wife, that his wrath was kindled.
And Joseph's master took him, and
put him into the prison, a place where
the king's prisoners were bound: and
he was there in the prison.</p>

<span class='location'>IN THE UFFIZI GALLERY, FLORENCE</span></div>
</div>

<p>But the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was with Joseph, and
shewed him mercy, and gave him favour
in the sight of the keeper of the
prison. And the keeper of the prison
committed to Joseph's hand all the
prisoners that were in the prison; and
whatsoever they did there, he was the
doer of it. The keeper of the prison
looked not to any thing that was under
his hand; because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was
with him, and that which he did, the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> made it to prosper.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Genesis 40</div>


<p>And it came to pass after these
things, that the butler of the king of
Egypt and his baker had offended
their lord the king of Egypt. And
Pharaoh was wroth against two of his
officers, against the chief of the butlers,
and against the chief of the
bakers. And he put them in ward
in the house of the captain of the
guard, into the prison, the place
where Joseph was bound. And the
captain of the guard charged Joseph
with them, and he served them: and
they continued a season in ward.</p>

<p>And they dreamed a dream both of
them, each man his dream in one
night, each man according to the interpretation
of his dream, the butler
and the baker of the king of Egypt,
which were bound in the prison. And
Joseph came in unto them in the
morning, and looked upon them, and,
behold, they were sad. And he asked
Pharaoh's officers that were with him
in the ward of his lord's house, saying,
Wherefore look ye so sadly to
day? And they said unto him, We
have dreamed a dream, and there is
no interpreter of it. And Joseph
said unto them, Do not interpretations
belong to God? tell me them, I
pray you. And the chief butler told
his dream to Joseph, and said to him,
In my dream, behold, a vine was before
me; and in the vine were three
branches: and it was as though it
budded, and her blossoms shot forth;
and the clusters thereof brought forth
ripe grapes: and Pharaoh's cup was
in my hand: and I took the grapes,
and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup,
and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's
hand.</p>

<p>And Joseph said unto him, This
is the interpretation of it: The three
branches are three days: yet within
three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine
head, and restore thee unto thy place:
and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup
into his hand, after the former manner
when thou wast his butler. But
think on me when it shall be well
with thee, and shew kindness, I pray
thee, unto me, and make mention of
me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out
of this house: for indeed I was stolen
away out of the land of the Hebrews:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and here also have I done nothing
that they should put me into the
dungeon.</p>

<p>When the chief baker saw that the
interpretation was good, he said unto
Joseph, I also was in my dream, and,
behold, I had three white baskets
on my head: and in the uppermost
basket there was of all manner of
bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds
did eat them out of the basket upon
my head. And Joseph answered and
said, This is the interpretation thereof:
The three baskets are three
days: yet within three days shall
Pharaoh lift up thy head from off
thee, and shall hang thee on a tree;
and the birds shall eat thy flesh from
off thee.</p>

<p>And it came to pass the third day,
which was Pharaoh's birthday, that
he made a feast unto all his servants:
and he lifted up the head of the chief
butler and of the chief baker among
his servants. And he restored the
chief butler unto his butlership again;
and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's
hand: but he hanged the chief baker:
as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Yet did not the chief butler remember
Joseph, but forgat him.</p>

<small>JOSEPH BEFORE PHARAOH</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 41</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass at the end
of two full years, that Pharaoh
dreamed: and, behold,
he stood by the river. And, behold,
there came up out of the river seven
well favoured kine and fatfleshed;
and they fed in a meadow. And, behold,
seven other kine came up after
them out of the river, ill favoured and
leanfleshed; and stood by the other
kine upon the brink of the river.
And the ill favoured and leanfleshed
kine did eat up the seven well favoured
and fat kine. So Pharaoh
awoke. And he slept and dreamed
the second time: and, behold, seven
ears of corn came up upon one stalk,
rank and good. And, behold, seven
thin ears and blasted with the east
wind sprung up after them. And
the seven thin ears devoured the
seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh
awoke, and, behold, it was a
dream. And it came to pass in the
morning that his spirit was troubled;
and he sent and called for all the
magicians of Egypt, and all the
wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told
them his dream; but there was none
that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</div>

<p>Then spake the chief butler unto
Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my
faults this day: Pharaoh was wroth
with his servants, and put me in ward
in the captain of the guard's house,
both me and the chief baker: and
we dreamed a dream in one night, I
and he; we dreamed each man according
to the interpretation of his
dream. And there was there with us
a young man, an Hebrew, servant to
the captain of the guard; and we
told him, and he interpreted to us
our dreams; to each man according to
his dream he did interpret. And it
came to pass, as he interpreted to us,
so it was; me he restored unto mine
office, and him he hanged.</p>

<p>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph,
and they brought him hastily
out of the dungeon: and he shaved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
himself, and changed his raiment,
and came in unto Pharaoh. And
Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have
dreamed a dream, and there is none
that can interpret it: and I have
heard say of thee, that thou canst understand
a dream to interpret it.
And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying,
It is not in me: God shall give
Pharaoh an answer of peace.</p>

<p>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
In my dream, behold, I stood upon
the bank of the river: and, behold,
there came up out of the river seven
kine, fatfleshed and well favoured;
and they fed in a meadow: and, behold,
seven other kine came up after
them, poor and very ill favoured and
leanfleshed, such as I never saw in
all the land of Egypt for badness:
and the lean and the ill favoured kine
did eat up the first seven fat kine:
and when they had eaten them up,
it could not be known that they had
eaten them; but they were still ill
favoured, as at the beginning. So I
awoke.</p>

<p>And I saw in my dream, and, behold,
seven ears came up in one stalk,
full and good: and, behold, seven
ears, withered, thin, and blasted with
the east wind, sprung up after them:
and the thin ears devoured the seven
good ears: and I told this unto the
magicians; but there was none that
could declare it to me.</p>

<p>And Joseph said unto Pharaoh,
The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
hath shewed Pharaoh what he is
about to do. The seven good kine
are seven years; and the seven good
ears are seven years: the dream is
one. And the seven thin and ill favoured
kine that came up after them
are seven years; and the seven empty
ears blasted with the east wind shall
be seven years of famine. This is
the thing which I have spoken unto
Pharaoh: What God is about to do he
sheweth unto Pharaoh. Behold, there
come seven years of great plenty
throughout all the land of Egypt:
and there shall arise after them
seven years of famine; and all the
plenty shall be forgotten in the land
of Egypt; and the famine shall consume
the land; and the plenty shall
not be known in the land by reason
of that famine following; for it shall
be very grievous. And for that the
dream was doubled unto Pharaoh
twice; it is because the thing is established
by God, and God will
shortly bring it to pass. Now therefore
let Pharaoh look out a man discreet
and wise, and set him over the
land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh do this,
and let him appoint officers over the
land, and take up the fifth part of the
land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
years. And let them gather all the
food of those good years that come,
and lay up corn under the hand of
Pharaoh, and let them keep food in
the cities. And that food shall be for
store to the land against the seven
years of famine, which shall be in the
land of Egypt; that the land perish
not through the famine.</p>

<p>And the thing was good in the eyes
of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his
servants.</p>

<p>And Pharaoh said unto his servants,
Can we find such a one as this
is, a man in whom the Spirit of God
is? And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee
all this, there is none so discreet and
wise as thou art: thou shalt be over
my house, and according unto thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
word shall all my people be ruled:
only in the throne will I be greater
than thou. And Pharaoh said unto
Joseph, See, I have set thee over all
the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh
took off his ring from his hand, and
put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed
him in vestures of fine linen,
and put a gold chain about his neck;
and he made him to ride in the second
chariot which he had; and they
cried before him, Bow the knee: and
he made him ruler over all the land
of Egypt. And Pharaoh said unto
Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without
thee shall no man lift up his hand
or foot in all the land of Egypt.
And Pharaoh called Joseph's name
Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him
to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah
priest of On.</p>

<p>And Joseph was thirty years old
when he stood before Pharaoh king
of Egypt. And Joseph went out
from the presence of Pharaoh, and
went throughout all the land of
Egypt.</p>

<p>And in the seven plenteous years
the earth brought forth by handfuls.
And he gathered up all the food of
the seven years, which were in the
land of Egypt, and laid up the food
in the cities: the food of the field,
which was round about every city,
laid he up in the same. And Joseph
gathered corn as the sand of the sea,
very much, until he left numbering;
for it was without number.</p>

<p>And unto Joseph were born two
sons before the years of famine came,
which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah
priest of On bare unto him.
And Joseph called the name of the
firstborn Manasseh: For God, said
he, hath made me forget all my toil,
and all my father's house. And the
name of the second called he Ephraim:
For God hath caused me to be
fruitful in the land of my affliction.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_21" id="CHAPTER_21">CHAPTER 21</a><br />

<small>THE FAMINE</small></h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the seven years of plenteousness,
that was in the land
of Egypt, were ended. And
the seven years of dearth began to
come, according as Joseph had said:
and the dearth was in all lands; but
in all the land of Egypt there was
bread. And when all the land of
Egypt was famished, the people cried
to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh
said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto
Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
And the famine was over all the face
of the earth: And Joseph opened all
the storehouses, and sold unto the
Egyptians; and the famine waxed
sore in the land of Egypt. And all
countries came into Egypt to Joseph
for to buy corn; because that
the famine was so sore in all
lands.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 42</div>

<p>Now when Jacob saw that there
was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto
his sons, Why do ye look one upon
another? And he said, Behold, I have
heard that there is corn in Egypt:
get you down thither, and buy for us
from thence; that we may live, and
not die.</p>

<p>And Joseph's ten brethren went
down to buy corn in Egypt. But
Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob
sent not with his brethren; for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
said, Lest peradventure mischief befall
him. And the sons of Israel
came to buy corn among those that
came: for the famine was in the land
of Canaan. And Joseph was the governor
over the land, and he it was
that sold to all the people of the land:
and Joseph's brethren came, and
bowed down themselves before him
with their faces to the earth.</p>

<p>And Joseph saw his brethren, and
he knew them, but made himself
strange unto them, and spake roughly
unto them; and he said unto them,
Whence come ye? And they said,
From the land of Canaan to buy
food. And Joseph knew his brethren,
but they knew not him.</p>

<p>And Joseph remembered the dreams
which he dreamed of them, and said
unto them, Ye are spies; to see the
nakedness of the land ye are come.
And they said unto him, Nay, my
lord, but to buy food are thy servants
come. We are all one man's sons;
we are true men, thy servants are no
spies. And he said unto them, Nay,
but to see the nakedness of the land
ye are come. And they said, Thy
servants are twelve brethren, the
sons of one man in the land of Canaan;
and, behold, the youngest is
this day with our father, and one is
not.</p>

<p>And Joseph said unto them, That
is it that I spake unto you, saying,
Ye are spies: hereby ye shall be
proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye
shall not go forth hence, except your
youngest brother come hither. Send
one of you, and let him fetch your
brother, and ye shall be kept in
prison, that your words may be
proved, whether there be any truth
in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh
surely ye are spies. And he
put them all together into ward three
days.</p>

<p>And Joseph said unto them the
third day, This do, and live; for I
fear God: if ye be true men, let one
of your brethren be bound in the
house of your prison: go ye, carry
corn for the famine of your houses:
but bring your youngest brother unto
me; so shall your words be verified,
and ye shall not die. And they did
so.</p>

<p>And they said one to another, We
are verily guilty concerning our brother,
in that we saw the anguish of
his soul, when he besought us, and we
would not hear; therefore is this distress
come upon us. And Reuben
answered them, saying, Spake I not
unto you, saying, Do not sin against
the child; and ye would not hear?
therefore, behold, also his blood is
required. And they knew not that
Joseph understood them; for he
spake unto them by an interpreter.
And he turned himself about from
them, and wept; and returned to
them again, and communed with
them, and took from them Simeon,
and bound him before their eyes.</p>

<p>Then Joseph commanded to fill
their sacks with corn, and to restore
every man's money into his sack, and
to give them provision for the way:
and thus did he unto them. And they
laded their asses with the corn, and
departed thence. And as one of them
opened his sack to give his ass provender
in the inn, he espied his money;
for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.
And he said unto his brethren, My
money is restored; and, lo, it is even
in my sack: and their heart failed
them, and they were afraid, saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
one to another, What is this that God
hath done unto us?</p>

<p>And they came unto Jacob their father
unto the land of Canaan, and
told him all that befell unto them;
saying, The man, who is the lord of
the land, spake roughly to us, and
took us for spies of the country. And
we said unto him, We are true men;
we are no spies: we be twelve brethren,
sons of our father; one is not,
and the youngest is this day with our
father in the land of Canaan. And
the man, the lord of the country, said
unto us, Hereby shall I know that
ye are true men; leave one of your
brethren here with me, and take food
for the famine of your households,
and be gone: and bring your youngest
brother unto me: then shall I
know that ye are no spies, but that
ye are true men: so will I deliver you
your brother, and ye shall traffick in
the land.</p>

<p>And it came to pass as they emptied
their sacks, that, behold, every
man's bundle of money was in his
sack: and when both they and their
father saw the bundles of money, they
were afraid. And Jacob their father
said unto them, Me have ye bereaved
of my children: Joseph is not,
and Simeon is not, and ye will take
Benjamin away: all these things are
against me. And Reuben spake unto
his father, saying, Slay my two sons,
if I bring him not to thee: deliver
him into my hand, and I will bring
him to thee again. And he said, My
son shall not go down with you; for
his brother is dead, and he is left
alone: if mischief befall him by the
way in the which ye go, then shall
ye bring down my gray hairs with
sorrow to the grave.</p>

<small>BENJAMIN BROUGHT TO JOSEPH</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 43</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND the famine was sore in the
land. And it came to pass,
when they had eaten up the
corn which they had brought out of
Egypt, their father said unto them,
Go again, buy us a little food. And
Judah spake unto him, saying, The
man did solemnly protest unto us,
saying, Ye shall not see my face, except
your brother be with you. If
thou wilt send our brother with us,
we will go down and buy thee food:
but if thou wilt not send him, we will
not go down: for the man said unto
us, Ye shall not see my face, except
your brother be with you.</div>

<p>And Israel said, Wherefore dealt
ye so ill with me, as to tell the man
whether ye had yet a brother? And
they said, The man asked us straitly
of our state, and of our kindred, saying,
Is your father yet alive? have
ye another brother? and we told him
according to the tenor of these words:
could we certainly know that he
would say, Bring your brother
down?</p>

<p>And Judah said unto Israel his father,
Send the lad with me, and we
will arise and go; that we may live,
and not die, both we, and thou, and
also our little ones. I will be surety
for him; of my hand shalt thou require
him: if I bring him not unto
thee, and set him before thee, then let
me bear the blame for ever: for except
we had lingered, surely now we
had returned this second time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>And their father Israel said unto
them, If it must be so now, do this;
take of the best fruits in the land in
your vessels, and carry down the man
a present, a little balm, and a little
honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and
almonds: and take double money in
your hand; and the money that was
brought again in the mouth of your
sacks, carry it again in your hand;
peradventure it was an oversight:
take also your brother, and arise,
go again unto the man: and God
Almighty give you mercy before the
man, that he may send away your
other brother, and Benjamin. If I be
bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.</p>

<p>And the men took that present, and
they took double money in their hand,
and Benjamin; and rose up, and went
down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
And when Joseph saw Benjamin
with them, he said to the ruler
of his house, Bring these men home,
and slay, and make ready; for these
men shall dine with me at noon.</p>

<p>And the man did as Joseph bade;
and the man brought the men into
Joseph's house. And the men were
afraid, because they were brought
into Joseph's house; and they said,
Because of the money that was returned
in our sacks at the first time
are we brought in; that he may seek
occasion against us, and fall upon us,
and take us for bondmen, and our
asses.</p>

<p>And they came near to the steward
of Joseph's house, and they communed
with him at the door of the
house, and said, O sir, we came indeed
down at the first time to buy
food: and it came to pass, when we
came to the inn, that we opened our
sacks, and, behold, every man's money
was in the mouth of his sack, our
money in full weight: and we have
brought it again in our hand. And
other money have we brought down
in our hands to buy food: we cannot
tell who put our money in our sacks.
And he said, Peace be to you, fear
not: your God, and the God of your
father, hath given you treasure in
your sacks: I had your money. And
he brought Simeon out unto them.
And the man brought the men into
Joseph's house, and gave them water,
and they washed their feet; and
he gave their asses provender. And
they made ready the present against
Joseph came at noon: for they heard
that they should eat bread there.</p>

<p>And when Joseph came home, they
brought him the present which was in
their hand into the house, and bowed
themselves to him to the earth. And
he asked them of their welfare, and
said, Is your father well, the old
man of whom ye spake? Is he yet
alive? And they answered, Thy servant
our father is in good health,
he is yet alive. And they bowed
down their heads, and made obeisance.</p>

<p>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw
his brother Benjamin, his mother's
son, and said, Is this your younger
brother, of whom ye spake unto me?
And he said, God be gracious unto
thee, my son. And Joseph made
haste; for his bowels did yearn upon
his brother: and he sought where to
weep; and he entered into his chamber,
and wept there. And he washed
his face, and went out, and refrained
himself, and said, Set on bread.</p>

<p>And they set on for him by himself,
and for them by themselves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
loveth him. And thou saidst unto
thy servants, Bring him down unto
me, that I may set mine eyes upon
him. And we said unto my lord,
The lad cannot leave his father: for
if he should leave his father, his father
would die. And thou saidst unto
thy servants, Except your youngest
brother come down with you, ye shall
see my face no more. And it came
to pass when we came up unto thy
servant my father, we told him the
words of my lord. And our father
said, Go again, and buy us a little
food. And we said, We cannot go
down: if our youngest brother be with
us, then will we go down: for we may
not see the man's face, except our
youngest brother be with us. And
thy servant my father said unto us,
Ye know that my wife bare me two
sons: and the one went out from me,
and I said, Surely he is torn in
pieces; and I saw him not since: and
if ye take this also from me, and
mischief befall him, ye shall bring
down my gray hairs with sorrow to
the grave. Now therefore when I
come to thy servant my father, and
the lad be not with us; seeing that his
life is bound up in the lad's life; it
shall come to pass, when he seeth
that the lad is not with us, that he
will die: and thy servants shall bring
down the gray hairs of thy servant
our father with sorrow to the grave.
For thy servant became surety for
the lad unto my father, saying, If I
bring him not unto thee, then I shall
bear the blame to my father for ever.
Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy
servant abide instead of the lad a
bondman to my lord; and let the lad
go up with his brethren. For how
shall I go up to my father, and the
lad be not with me? lest peradventure
I see the evil that shall come on my
father.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 45</div>

<p>Then Joseph could not refrain himself
before all them that stood by him;
and he cried, Cause every man to go
out from me. And there stood no
man with him, while Joseph made
himself known unto his brethren.
And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians
and the house of Pharaoh heard.
And Joseph said unto his brethren,
I am Joseph; doth my father yet
live? And his brethren could not
answer him; for they were troubled
at his presence. And Joseph said
unto his brethren, Come near to me,
I pray you. And they came near.
And he said, I am Joseph your brother,
whom ye sold into Egypt. Now
therefore be not grieved, nor angry
with yourselves, that ye sold me
hither: for God did send me before
you to preserve life. For these two
years hath the famine been in the
land: and yet there are five years, in
the which there shall neither be earing
nor harvest. And God sent me
before you to preserve you a posterity
in the earth, and to save your lives
by a great deliverance. So now it
was not you that sent me hither, but
God: and he hath made me a father
to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house,
and a ruler throughout all the land of
Egypt.</p>

<p>Haste ye, and go up to my father,
and say unto him, Thus saith thy son
Joseph, God hath made me lord of all
Egypt: come down unto me, tarry
not: and thou shalt dwell in the land
of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto
me, thou, and thy children, and thy
children's children, and thy flocks,
and thy herds, and all that thou hast:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
for the Egyptians, which did eat
with him, by themselves: because the
Egyptians might not eat bread with
the Hebrews. And they sat before
him, the firstborn according to his
birthright, and the youngest according
to his youth: and the men marvelled
one at another. And he took
and sent messes unto them from before
him: but Benjamin's mess was
five times so much as any of their's.
And they drank, and were merry with
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 44</div>

<p>And he commanded the steward of
his house, saying, Fill the men's
sacks with food, as much as they can
carry, and put every man's money in
his sack's mouth. And put my cup,
the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of
the youngest, and his corn money.
And he did according to the word
that Joseph had spoken.</p>

<p>As soon as the morning was light,
the men were sent away, they and
their asses. And when they were
gone out of the city, and not yet far
off, Joseph said unto his steward,
Up, follow after the men; and when
thou dost overtake them, say unto
them, Wherefore have ye rewarded
evil for good? is not this it in which
my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed
he divineth? ye have done evil
in so doing.</p>

<p>And he overtook them, and he
spake unto them these same words.
And they said unto him, Wherefore
saith my lord these words? God forbid
that thy servants should do according
to this thing: behold, the
money, which we found in our sacks'
mouths, we brought again unto thee
out of the land of Canaan: how then
should we steal out of thy lord's house
silver or gold? with whomsoever of
thy servants it be found, both let him
die, and we also will be my lord's
bondmen. And he said, Now also
let it be according unto your words:
he with whom it is found shall be my
servant; and ye shall be blameless.
Then they speedily took down every
man his sack to the ground, and
opened every man his sack. And he
searched, and began at the eldest, and
left at the youngest: and the cup was
found in Benjamin's sack. Then they
rent their clothes, and laded every
man his ass, and returned to the city.</p>

<p>And Judah and his brethren came
to Joseph's house; for he was yet
there: and they fell before him on the
ground.</p>

<p>And Joseph said unto them, What
deed is this that ye have done? wot
ye not that such a man as I can certainly
divine? And Judah said,
What shall we say unto my lord?
what shall we speak? or how shall we
clear ourselves? God hath found out
the iniquity of thy servants: behold,
we are my lord's servants, both we,
and he also with whom the cup is
found. And he said, God forbid that
I should do so: but the man in whose
hand the cup is found, he shall be my
servant; and as for you, get you up
in peace unto your father.</p>

<p>Then Judah came near unto him,
and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant,
I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's
ears, and let not thine anger burn
against thy servant: for thou art even
as Pharaoh. My lord asked his servants,
saying, Have ye a father, or
a brother? And we said unto my
lord, We have a father, an old man,
and a child of his old age, a little one;
and his brother is dead, and he alone
is left of his mother, and his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and there will I nourish thee; for yet
there are five years of famine; lest
thou, and thy household, and all that
thou hast, come to poverty. And,
behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of
my brother Benjamin, that it is my
mouth that speaketh unto you. And
ye shall tell my father of all my glory
in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen;
and ye shall haste and bring down my
father hither. And he fell upon his
brother Benjamin's neck, and wept;
and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
Moreover he kissed all his brethren,
and wept upon them: and after that
his brethren talked with him.</p>

<p>And the fame thereof was heard
in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's
brethren are come: and it pleased
Pharaoh well, and his servants. And
Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto
thy brethren, This do ye; lade your
beasts, and go, get you unto the land
of Canaan; and take your father and
your households, and come unto me:
and I will give you the good of the
land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the
fat of the land. Now thou art commanded,
this do ye; take you wagons
out of the land of Egypt for your little
ones, and for your wives, and
bring your father, and come. Also
regard not your stuff; for the good of
all the land of Egypt is your's.</p>

<p>And the children of Israel did so:
and Joseph gave them wagons, according
to the commandment of Pharaoh,
and gave them provision for the
way. To all of them he gave each
man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin
he gave three hundred pieces
of silver, and five changes of raiment.
And to his father he sent after this
manner; ten asses laden with the good
things of Egypt, and ten she asses
laden with corn and bread and meat
for his father by the way. So he sent
his brethren away, and they departed:
and he said unto them, See that ye
fall not out by the way.</p>

<p>And they went up out of Egypt,
and came into the land of Canaan
unto Jacob their father, and told
him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and
he is governor over all the land of
Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted,
for he believed them not. And they
told him all the words of Joseph,
which he had said unto them: and
when he saw the wagons which Joseph
had sent to carry him, the spirit
of Jacob their father revived: and
Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my
son is yet alive: I will go and see him
before I die.</p>

<small>ISRAEL GOES DOWN INTO EGYPT</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 46</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND Israel took his journey with
all that he had, and came
to Beer-sheba, and offered
sacrifices unto the God of his father
Isaac. And God spake unto Israel in
the visions of the night, and said,
Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here
am I. And he said, I am God, the
God of thy father: fear not to go
down into Egypt; for I will there
make of thee a great nation: I will
go down with thee into Egypt; and
I will also surely bring thee up again:
and Joseph shall put his hand upon
thine eyes.</div>

<p>And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba:
and the sons of Israel carried Jacob
their father, and their little ones,
and their wives, in the wagons which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Pharaoh had sent to carry him. And
they took their cattle, and their goods,
which they had gotten in the land of
Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob,
and all his seed with him: his sons,
and his sons' sons with him, his
daughters, and his sons' daughters,
and all his seed brought he with him
into Egypt. And the sons of Joseph,
which were born him in Egypt, were
two souls: all the souls of the house
of Jacob, which came into Egypt,
were threescore and ten.</p>

<p>And he sent Judah before him unto
Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen;
and they came into the land of
Goshen. And Joseph made ready his
chariot, and went up to meet Israel
his father, to Goshen, and presented
himself unto him; and he fell on his
neck, and wept on his neck a good
while. And Israel said unto Joseph,
Now let me die, since I have seen
thy face, because thou art yet alive.</p>

<p>And Joseph said unto his brethren,
and unto his father's house, I will
go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say
unto him, My brethren, and my father's
house, which were in the land
of Canaan, are come unto me; and
the men are shepherds, for their trade
hath been to feed cattle; and they
have brought their flocks, and their
herds, and all that they have. And
it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh
shall call you, and shall say, What is
your occupation? that ye shall say,
Thy servants' trade hath been about
cattle from our youth even until now,
both we, and also our fathers: that
ye may dwell in the land of Goshen;
for every shepherd is an abomination
unto the Egyptians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 47</div>

<p>Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh,
and said, My father and my
brethren, and their flocks, and their
herds, and all that they have, are come
out of the land of Canaan; and, behold,
they are in the land of Goshen.
And he took some of his brethren,
even five men, and presented them
unto Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said
unto his brethren, What is your occupation?
And they said unto Pharaoh,
Thy servants are shepherds,
both we, and also our fathers. They
said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to
sojourn in the land are we come; for
thy servants have no pasture for their
flocks; for the famine is sore in the
land of Canaan: now therefore, we
pray thee, let thy servants dwell in
the land of Goshen.</p>

<p>And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph,
saying, Thy father and thy brethren
are come unto thee: the land of Egypt
is before thee; in the best of the
land make thy father and brethren
to dwell; in the land of Goshen let
them dwell: and if thou knowest any
men of activity among them, then
make them rulers over my cattle.
And Joseph brought in Jacob his father,
and set him before Pharaoh: and
Jacob blessed Pharaoh. And Pharaoh
said unto Jacob, How old art
thou? And Jacob said unto Pharaoh,
The days of the years of my pilgrimage
are an hundred and thirty
years: few and evil have the days of
the years of my life been, and have
not attained unto the days of the years
of the life of my fathers in the days
of their pilgrimage. And Jacob
blessed Pharaoh, and went out from
before Pharaoh.</p>

<p>And Joseph placed his father and
his brethren, and gave them a possession
in the land of Egypt, in the
best of the land, in the land of Rameses,
as Pharaoh had commanded.
And Joseph nourished his father, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
his brethren, and all his father's
household, with bread, according to
their families.</p>

<p>And there was no bread in all the
land; for the famine was very sore,
so that the land of Egypt and all the
land of Canaan fainted by reason of
the famine. And Joseph gathered up
all the money that was found in the
land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan,
for the corn which they bought:
and Joseph brought the money into
Pharaoh's house. And when money
failed in the land of Egypt, and in
the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians
came unto Joseph, and said, Give
us bread: for why should we die in
thy presence? for the money faileth.
And Joseph said, Give your cattle;
and I will give you for your cattle,
if money fail. And they brought
their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph
gave them bread in exchange for
horses, and for the flocks, and for the
cattle of the herds, and for the asses:
and he fed them with bread for all
their cattle for that year. When that
year was ended, they came unto him
the second year, and said unto him,
We will not hide it from my lord,
how that our money is spent; my lord
also hath our herds of cattle; there is
not ought left in the sight of my lord,
but our bodies, and our lands: wherefore
shall we die before thine eyes,
both we and our land? buy us and
our land for bread, and we and our
land will be servants unto Pharaoh:
and give us seed, that we may live,
and not die, that the land be not desolate.
And Joseph bought all the
land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
Egyptians sold every man his field,
because the famine prevailed over
them: so the land became Pharaoh's.
And as for the people, he removed
them to cities from one end of the
borders of Egypt even to the other
end thereof. Only the land of the
priests bought he not; for the priests
had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh,
and did eat their portion which
Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they
sold not their lands.</p>

<p>Then Joseph said unto the people,
Behold, I have bought you this day
and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here
is seed for you, and ye shall sow the
land. And it shall come to pass in the
increase, that ye shall give the fifth
part unto Pharaoh, and four parts
shall be your own, for seed of the
field, and for your food, and for them
of your households, and for food for
your little ones. And they said,
Thou hast saved our lives: let us
find grace in the sight of my lord, and
we will be Pharaoh's servants. And
Joseph made it a law over the land
of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh
should have the fifth part; except the
land of the priests only, which became
not Pharaoh's.</p>

<p>And Israel dwelt in the land of
Egypt, in the country of Goshen;
and they had possessions therein, and
grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt
seventeen years: so the whole age of
Jacob was an hundred forty and
seven years.</p>

things, that one told Joseph, Behold,
thy father is sick: and he took with
him his two sons, Manasseh and
Ephraim. And one told Jacob, and
said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh
unto thee: and Israel strengthened
himself, and sat upon the bed. And
Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty
appeared unto me at Luz in
the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
and said unto me, Behold, I will make
thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and
I will make of thee a multitude of
people; and will give this land to thy
seed after thee for an everlasting
possession.</p>

<p>And now thy two sons, Ephraim
and Manasseh, which were born unto
thee in the land of Egypt before I
came unto thee into Egypt, are mine;
as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be
mine. And thy issue, which thou begettest
after them, shall be thine, and
shall be called after the name of their
brethren in their inheritance. And
as for me, when I came from Padan,
Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan
in the way, when yet there
was but a little way to come unto Ephrath:
and I buried her there in the
way of Ephrath; the same is Beth-lehem.</p>

<p>And Israel beheld Joseph's sons,
and said, Who are these? And Joseph
said unto his father, They are
my sons, whom God hath given me
in this place. And he said, Bring
them, I pray thee, unto me, and I
will bless them. Now the eyes of
Israel were dim for age, so that he
could not see. And he brought them
near unto him; and he kissed them,
and embraced them. And Israel said
unto Joseph, I had not thought to
see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed
me also thy seed.</p>

<p>And Joseph brought them out from
between his knees, and he bowed himself
with his face to the earth. And
Joseph took them both, Ephraim in
his right hand toward Israel's left
hand, and Manasseh in his left hand
toward Israel's right hand, and
brought them near unto him. And Israel
stretched out his right hand, and
laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was
the younger, and his left hand upon
Manasseh's head, guiding his hands
wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</p>

<p>And he blessed Joseph, and said,
God, before whom my fathers Abraham
and Isaac did walk, the God
which fed me all my life long unto
this day, the Angel which redeemed
me from all evil, bless the lads; and
let my name be named on them,
and the name of my fathers Abraham
and Isaac; and let them grow
into a multitude in the midst of the
earth.</p>

<p>And when Joseph saw that his father
laid his right hand upon the head
of Ephraim, it displeased him: and
he held up his father's hand, to remove
it from Ephraim's head unto
Manasseh's head. And Joseph said
unto his father, Not so, my father:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
for this is the firstborn; put thy right
hand upon his head. And his father
refused, and said, I know it, my son,
I know it: he also shall become a people,
and he also shall be great: but
truly his younger brother shall be
greater than he, and his seed shall become
a multitude of nations. And
he blessed them that day, saying, In
thee shall Israel bless, saying, God
make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh:
and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</p>

<p>And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold,
I die: but God shall be with you,
and bring you again unto the land of
your fathers. Moreover I have given
to thee one portion above thy brethren,
which I took out of the hand of
the Amorite with my sword and with
my bow.</p>

<p>And Jacob called unto his sons, and
said, Gather yourselves together, and
hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken
unto Israel your father. And he
charged them, and said unto them, I
am to be gathered unto my people:
bury me with my fathers in the cave
that is in the field of Ephron the
Hittite, in the cave that is in the
field of Machpelah, which is before
Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which
Abraham bought for a possession of
a buryingplace. There they buried
Abraham and Sarah his wife; there
they buried Isaac and Rebekah his
wife; and there I buried Leah. The
purchase of the field and of the cave
that is therein was from the children
of Heth.</p>

<p>And when Jacob had made an end
of commanding his sons, he gathered
up his feet into the bed, and yielded
up the ghost, and was gathered unto
his people.</p>

<small>THE BURIAL OF JACOB</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Genesis 50</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND Joseph fell upon his father's
face, and wept upon him, and
kissed him. And Joseph commanded
his servants the physicians to
embalm his father: and the physicians
embalmed Israel. And forty days
were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled
the days of those which are embalmed:
and the Egyptians mourned
for him threescore and ten days. And
when the days of his mourning were
past, Joseph spake unto the house of
Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found
grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you,
in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, My
father made me swear, saying, Lo, I
die: in my grave which I have digged
for me in the land of Canaan, there
shalt thou bury me. Now therefore
let me go up, I pray thee, and bury
my father, and I will come again.</div>

<p>And Pharaoh said, Go up, and
bury thy father, according as he made
thee swear.</p>

<p>And Joseph went up to bury his
father: and with him went up all the
servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his
house, and all the elders of the land
of Egypt, and all the house of Joseph,
and his brethren, and his father's
house: only their little ones,
and their flocks, and their herds, they
left in the land of Goshen. And there
went up with him both chariots and
horsemen: and it was a very great
company. And they came to the
threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
Jordan, and there they mourned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
with a great and very sore lamentation:
and he made a mourning for his
father seven days. And when the inhabitants
of the land, the Canaanites,
saw the mourning in the floor of Atad,
they said, This is a grievous mourning
to the Egyptians: wherefore the
name of it was called Abel-mizraim,
which is beyond Jordan. And his
sons did unto him according as he
commanded them: for his sons carried
him into the land of Canaan, and
buried him in the cave of the field of
Machpelah, which Abraham bought.</p>

<p>And Joseph returned into Egypt,
he, and his brethren, and all that went
up with him to bury his father, after
he had buried his father.</p>

<p>And when Joseph's brethren saw
that their father was dead, they said,
Joseph will peradventure hate us,
and will certainly requite us all the
evil which we did unto him. And
they sent a messenger unto Joseph,
saying, Thy father did command before
he died, saying, So shall ye say
unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee
now, the trespass of thy brethren,
and their sin; for they did unto thee
evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive
the trespass of the servants of the
God of thy father. And Joseph wept
when they spake unto him. And his
brethren also went and fell down
before his face; and they said, Behold,
we be thy servants. And Joseph
said unto them, Fear not: for
am I in the place of God? But as for
you, ye thought evil against me; but
God meant it unto good, to bring to
pass, as it is this day, to save much
people alive. Now therefore fear ye
not: I will nourish you, and your little
ones. And he comforted them,
and spake kindly unto them.</p>

<p>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he,
and his father's house: and Joseph
lived an hundred and ten years. And
Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the
third generation: the children also of
Machir the son of Manasseh were
brought up upon Joseph's knees.
And Joseph said unto his brethren, I
die: and God will surely visit you,
and bring you out of this land unto
the land which he sware to Abraham,
to Isaac, and to Jacob. And Joseph
took an oath of the children of Israel,
saying, God will surely visit you, and
ye shall carry up my bones from
hence. So Joseph died, being an hundred
and ten years old: and they embalmed
him, and he was put in a coffin
in Egypt.</p>

<h2>BOOK IV<br />

MOSES AND THE DELIVERANCE FROM EGYPT</h2>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_26" id="CHAPTER_26">CHAPTER 26</a><br />

<small>THE FINDING OF MOSES</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-n.jpg" width="150" height="176" alt="N" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">NOW these are the
names of the children
of Israel,
which came into
Egypt; every
man and his
household came
with Jacob. Reuben,
Simeon, Levi,
and Judah, Issachar, Zebulun,
and Benjamin, Dan, and Naphtali,
Gad, and Asher. And all the souls
that came from Jacob were seventy
souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.
And Joseph died, and all his
brethren, and all that generation.</div>

<p>And the children of Israel were
fruitful, and increased abundantly,
and multiplied, and waxed exceeding
mighty; and the land was filled with
them.</p>

<p>Now there arose up a new king over
Egypt, which knew not Joseph. And
he said unto his people, Behold, the
people of the children of Israel are
more and mightier than we: come on,
let us deal wisely with them; lest they
multiply, and it come to pass, that,
when there falleth out any war, they
join also unto our enemies, and fight
against us, and so get them up out of
the land. Therefore they did set over
them taskmasters to afflict them with
their burdens. And they built for
Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and
Raamses. But the more they afflicted
them, the more they multiplied and
grew. And they were grieved because
of the children of Israel. And
the Egyptians made the children of
Israel to serve with rigour: and they
made their lives bitter with hard bondage,
in morter, and in brick, and in
all manner of service in the field:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
all their service, wherein they made
them serve, was with rigour. And
the king of Egypt commanded that
all the male children of the Hebrews
be put to death. But the Hebrew
women did not as the king of Egypt
commanded them, but saved the men
children alive: and the people multiplied,
and waxed very mighty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 2</div>

<p>And there went a man of the house
of Levi, and took to wife a daughter
of Levi. And the woman bare a son:
and when she saw him that he was
a goodly child, she hid him three
months. And when she could not
longer hide him, she took for him
an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it
with slime and with pitch, and put
the child therein; and she laid it in
the flags by the river's brink. And
his sister stood afar off, to wit what
would be done to him.</p>

<p>And the daughter of Pharaoh came
down to wash herself at the river;
and her maidens walked along by the
river's side; and when she saw the
ark among the flags, she sent her maid
to fetch it. And when she had opened
it, she saw the child: and, behold, the
babe wept. And she had compassion
on him, and said, This is one of the
Hebrews' children. Then said his
sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall
I go and call to thee a nurse of the
Hebrew women, that she may nurse
the child for thee? And Pharaoh's
daughter said to her, Go. And the
maid went and called the child's
mother. And Pharaoh's daughter
said unto her, Take this child away,
and nurse it for me, and I will give
thee thy wages. And the woman took
the child, and nursed it. And the
child grew, and she brought him unto
Pharaoh's daughter, and he became
her son. And she called his name
Moses: and she said, Because I drew
him out of the water.</p>

<p>And it came to pass in those days,
when Moses was grown, that he went
out unto his brethren, and looked on
their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian
smiting an Hebrew, one of his
brethren. And he looked this way
and that way, and when he saw that
there was no man, he slew the Egyptian,
and hid him in the sand. And
when he went out the second day, behold,
two men of the Hebrews strove
together: and he said to him that did
the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou
thy fellow? And he said, Who made
thee a prince and a judge over us?
intendest thou to kill me, as thou
killedst the Egyptian? And Moses
feared, and said, Surely this thing is
known. Now when Pharaoh heard
this thing, he sought to slay Moses.
But Moses fled from the face of
Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of
Midian: and he sat down by a well.</p>

<p>Now the priest of Midian had seven
daughters: and they came and drew
water, and filled the troughs to water
their father's flock. And the shepherds
came and drove them away: but
Moses stood up and helped them, and
watered their flock. And when they
came to Reuel their father, he said,
How is it that ye are come so soon
to day? And they said, An Egyptian
delivered us out of the hand of
the shepherds, and also drew water
enough for us, and watered the flock.
And he said unto his daughters, And
where is he? why is it that ye have
left the man? call him, that he may
eat bread. And Moses was content
to dwell with the man: and he gave
Moses Zipporah his daughter. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
she bare him a son, and he called his
name Gershom: for he said, I have
been a stranger in a strange land.</p>

<p>And it came to pass in process of
time, that the king of Egypt died:
and the children of Israel sighed by
reason of the bondage, and they cried,
and their cry came up unto God by
reason of the bondage. And God
heard their groaning, and God remembered
his covenant with Abraham,
with Isaac, and with Jacob.
And God looked upon the children of
Israel, and God had respect unto
them.</p>

<small>THE BURNING BUSH</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 3</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>NOW Moses kept the flock of
Jethro his father in law, the
priest of Midian: and he led
the flock to the backside of the desert,
and came to the mountain of God,
even to Horeb. And the angel of the
LORD appeared unto him in a flame of
fire out of the midst of a bush: and he
looked, and, behold, the bush burned
with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
And Moses said, I will now
turn aside, and see this great sight,
why the bush is not burnt. And when
the LORD saw that he turned aside to
see, God called unto him out of the
midst of the bush, and said, Moses,
Moses. And he said, Here am I.
And he said, Draw not nigh hither:
put off thy shoes from off thy feet,
for the place whereon thou standest
is holy ground. Moreover he said,
I am the God of thy father, the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob. And Moses hid his
face; for he was afraid to look upon
God.</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said, I have surely
seen the affliction of my people which
are in Egypt, and have heard their
cry by reason of their taskmasters;
for I know their sorrows; and I am
come down to deliver them out of the
hand of the Egyptians, and to bring
them up out of that land unto a good
land and a large, unto a land flowing
with milk and honey. Now
therefore, behold, the cry of the children
of Israel is come unto me: and
I have also seen the oppression
wherewith the Egyptians oppress
them. Come now therefore, and I
will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
mayest bring forth my people the
children of Israel out of Egypt.</p>

<p>And Moses said unto God, Who am
I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and
that I should bring forth the children
of Israel out of Egypt?</p>

<p>And he said, Certainly I will be
with thee; and this shall be a token
unto thee, that I have sent thee:
When thou hast brought forth the
people out of Egypt, ye shall serve
God upon this mountain.</p>

<p>And Moses said unto God, Behold,
when I come unto the children of
Israel, and shall say unto them, The
God of your fathers hath sent me
unto you; and they shall say to me,
What is his name? what shall I say
unto them? And God said unto
Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he
said, Thus shalt thou say unto the
children of Israel, I AM hath sent me
unto you. And God said moreover
unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto
the children of Israel, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God
of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
hath sent me unto you: this is my
name for ever, and this is my memorial
unto all generations. Go, and
gather the elders of Israel together,
and say unto them, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of
your fathers, the God of Abraham,
of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto
me, saying, I have surely visited you,
and seen that which is done to you in
Egypt: and I have said, I will bring
you up out of the affliction of Egypt,
unto a land flowing with milk and
honey. And they shall hearken to
thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou
and the elders of Israel, unto the king
of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him,
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of the Hebrews hath
met with us: and now let us go, we
beseech thee, three days' journey into
the wilderness, that we may sacrifice
to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God.</p>

<p>And I am sure that the king of
Egypt will not let you go, no, not by
a mighty hand. And I will stretch
out my hand, and smite Egypt with
all my wonders which I will do in the
midst thereof: and after that he will
let you go. And I will give this people
favour in the sight of the Egyptians:
and it shall come to pass, that,
when ye go, ye shall not go empty:
but every woman shall borrow of her
neighbour, and of her that sojourneth
in her house, jewels of silver, and
jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye
shall put them upon your sons, and
upon your daughters; and ye shall
spoil the Egyptians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 4</div>

<p>And Moses answered and said, But,
behold, they will not believe me, nor
hearken unto my voice: for they will
say, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath not appeared unto
thee. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto him,
What is that in thine hand? And he
said, A rod. And he said, Cast it on
the ground. And he cast it on the
ground, and it became a serpent; and
Moses fled from before it. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Put forth thine
hand, and take it by the tail. And he
put forth his hand, and caught it, and
it became a rod in his hand: that they
may believe that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of
their fathers, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,
hath appeared unto thee.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said furthermore
unto him, Put now thine hand into thy
bosom. And he put his hand into
his bosom: and when he took it out,
behold, his hand was leprous as snow.
And he said, Put thine hand into thy
bosom again. And he put his hand
into his bosom again; and plucked it
out of his bosom, and, behold, it was
turned again as his other flesh. And
it shall come to pass, if they will not
believe thee, neither hearken to the
voice of the first sign, that they will
believe the voice of the latter sign.
And it shall come to pass, if they will
not believe also these two signs, neither
hearken unto thy voice, that
thou shalt take of the water of the
river, and pour it upon the dry land:
and the water which thou takest out
of the river shall become blood upon
the dry land.</p>

<p>And Moses said unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, O
my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither
heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken
unto thy servant: but I am slow of
speech, and of a slow tongue. And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto him, Who hath
made man's mouth? or who maketh
the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or
the blind? have not I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? Now
therefore go, and I will be with thy
mouth, and teach thee what thou
shalt say. And he said, O my Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
whom thou wilt send. And the anger
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was kindled against
Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the
Levite thy brother? I know that he
can speak well. And also, behold,
he cometh forth to meet thee: and
when he seeth thee, he will be glad
in his heart. And thou shalt speak
unto him, and put words in his
mouth: and I will be with thy mouth,
and with his mouth, and will teach
you what ye shall do. And he shall
be thy spokesman unto the people:
and he shall be, even he shall be to
thee instead of a mouth, and thou
shalt be to him instead of God. And
thou shalt take this rod in thine hand,
wherewith thou shalt do signs.</p>

<p>And Moses went and returned to
Jethro his father in law, and said
unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and
return unto my brethren which are
in Egypt, and see whether they be
yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses,
Go in peace. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto
Moses in Midian, Go, return into
Egypt: for all the men are dead
which sought thy life. And Moses
took his wife and his sons, and set
them upon an ass, and he returned
to the land of Egypt: and Moses took
the rod of God in his hand. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, When thou goest
to return into Egypt, see that thou
do all those wonders before Pharaoh,
which I have put in thine hand: but
I will harden his heart, that he shall
not let the people go. And thou shalt
say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:
and I say unto thee, Let my son
go, that he may serve me: and if thou
refuse to let him go, behold, I will
slay thy son, even thy firstborn.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said to Aaron, Go
into the wilderness to meet Moses.
And he went, and met him in the
mount of God, and kissed him. And
Moses told Aaron all the words of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> who had sent him, and all the
signs which he had commanded him.
And Moses and Aaron went and
gathered together all the elders of
the children of Israel: and Aaron
spake all the words which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
had spoken unto Moses, and did the
signs in the sight of the people.
And the people believed: and when
they heard that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had visited
the children of Israel, and that he had
looked upon their affliction, then they
bowed their heads and worshipped.</p>

<small>THE ISRAELITES IN BONDAGE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Exodus 5</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND afterward Moses and Aaron
went in, and told Pharaoh,
Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of
Israel, Let my people go, that they
may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</div>

<p>And Pharaoh said, Who is the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that I should obey his voice to
let Israel go? I know not the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
neither will I let Israel go.</p>

<p>And they said, The God of the Hebrews
hath met with us: let us go,
we pray thee, three days' journey
into the desert, and sacrifice unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God; lest he fall upon us
with pestilence, or with the sword.
And the king of Egypt said unto
them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and
Aaron, let the people from their
works? get you unto your burdens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people
of the land now are many, and ye
make them rest from their burdens.
And Pharaoh commanded the same
day the taskmasters of the people,
and their officers, saying, Ye shall no
more give the people straw to make
brick, as heretofore: let them go and
gather straw for themselves. And
the tale of the bricks, which they did
make heretofore, ye shall lay upon
them; ye shall not diminish ought
thereof: for they be idle; therefore
they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice
to our God. Let there more
work be laid upon the men, that they
may labour therein; and let them not
regard vain words.</p>

<p>And the taskmasters of the people
went out, and their officers, and they
spake to the people, saying, Thus
saith Pharaoh, I will not give you
straw. Go ye, get you straw where
ye can find it: yet not ought of your
work shall be diminished. So the people
were scattered abroad throughout
all the land of Egypt to gather stubble
instead of straw. And the taskmasters
hasted them, saying, Fulfil
your works, your daily tasks, as when
there was straw. And the officers of
the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
taskmasters had set over them,
were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore
have ye not fulfilled your task
in making brick both yesterday and
to day, as heretofore?</p>

<p>Then the officers of the children of
Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh,
saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus
with thy servants? There is no straw
given unto thy servants, and they say
to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy
servants are beaten; but the fault is
in thine own people. But he said, Ye
are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say,
Let us go and do sacrifice to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
Go therefore now, and work; for
there shall no straw be given you,
yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.
And the officers of the children of
Israel did see that they were in evil
case, after it was said, Ye shall not
minish ought from your bricks of
your daily task.</p>

<p>And they met Moses and Aaron,
who stood in the way, as they came
forth from Pharaoh: and they said
unto them, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> look upon you,
and judge; because ye have made our
savour to be abhorred in the eyes of
Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants,
to put a sword in their hand
to slay us. And Moses returned unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said, Lord, wherefore
hast thou so evil entreated this people?
why is it that thou hast sent me?
for since I came to Pharaoh to speak
in thy name, he hath done evil to this
people; neither hast thou delivered
thy people at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 6</div>

<p>Then the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Now shalt thou see what I will do to
Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall
he let them go, and with a strong hand
shall he drive them out of his land.
And God spake unto Moses, and said
unto him, I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and I appeared
unto Abraham, unto Isaac,
and unto Jacob, by the name of God
Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH
was I not known to them. And
I have also established my covenant
with them, to give them the land of
Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage,
wherein they were strangers. And I
have also heard the groaning of the
children of Israel, whom the Egyptians
keep in bondage; and I have
remembered my covenant. Wherefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
say unto the children of Israel,
I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and I will bring you
out from under the burdens of the
Egyptians, and I will rid you out of
their bondage, and I will redeem you
with a stretched out arm, and with
great judgments: and I will take you
to me for a people, and I will be to
you a God: and ye shall know that
I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God, which bringeth
you out from under the burdens
of the Egyptians. And I will bring
you in unto the land, concerning the
which I did swear to give it to Abraham,
to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I
will give it you for an heritage: I am
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>And Moses spake so unto the children
of Israel: but they hearkened
not unto Moses for anguish of spirit,
and for cruel bondage. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses, saying, Go
in, speak unto Pharaoh king of
Egypt, that he let the children of
Israel go out of his land. And Moses
spake before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, saying, Behold,
the children of Israel have not
hearkened unto me; how then shall
Pharaoh hear me? And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
said unto Moses, See, I have made
thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron
thy brother shall be thy prophet.
Thou shalt speak all that I command
thee: and Aaron thy brother shall
speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the
children of Israel out of his land.
And I will harden Pharaoh's heart,
and multiply my signs and my wonders
in the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh
shall not hearken unto you, that
I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and
bring forth mine armies, and my people
the children of Israel, out of the
land of Egypt by great judgments.
And the Egyptians shall know that I
am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, when I stretch forth
mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out
the children of Israel from among
them. And Moses and Aaron did as
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded them, so did
they. And Moses was fourscore
years old, and Aaron fourscore and
three years old, when they spake
unto Pharaoh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 7</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses
and unto Aaron, saying, When Pharaoh
shall speak unto you, saying,
Shew a miracle for you: then thou
shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod,
and cast it before Pharaoh, and it
shall become a serpent.</p>

<p>And Moses and Aaron went in unto
Pharaoh, and they did so as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
had commanded: and Aaron cast
down his rod before Pharaoh, and before
his servants, and it became a
serpent. Then Pharaoh also called
the wise men and the sorcerers: now
the magicians of Egypt, they also did
in like manner with their enchantments.
For they cast down every
man his rod, and they became serpents:
but Aaron's rod swallowed up
their rods. And he hardened Pharaoh's
heart, that he hearkened not
unto them; as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had said.</p>

<small>THE PLAGUES OF BLOOD
AND FROGS</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Pharaoh's heart is hardened,
he refuseth to let the people
go. Get thee unto Pharaoh in
the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the
water; and thou shalt stand by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
river's brink against he come; and
the rod which was turned to a serpent
shalt thou take in thine hand.
And thou shalt say unto him, The
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of the Hebrews hath sent
me unto thee, saying, Let my people
go, that they may serve me in the
wilderness: and, behold, hitherto
thou wouldest not hear. Thus saith
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, In this thou shalt know that
I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: behold, I will smite
with the rod that is in mine hand upon
the waters which are in the river, and
they shall be turned to blood. And
the fish that is in the river shall die,
and the river shall stink; and the
Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the
water of the river.</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and
stretch out thine hand upon the waters
of Egypt, upon their streams,
upon their rivers, and upon their
ponds, and upon all their pools of
water, that they may become blood;
and that there may be blood throughout
all the land of Egypt, both in vessels
of wood, and in vessels of stone.
And Moses and Aaron did so, as the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded; and he lifted up
the rod, and smote the waters that
were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh,
and in the sight of his servants;
and all the waters that were in the
river were turned to blood. And the
fish that was in the river died; and
the river stank, and the Egyptians
could not drink of the water of the
river; and there was blood throughout
all the land of Egypt. And the
magicians of Egypt did so with their
enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart
was hardened, neither did he hearken
unto them; as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had said.</p>

<p>And Pharaoh turned and went into
his house, neither did he set his heart
to this also. And all the Egyptians
digged round about the river for water
to drink; for they could not drink
of the water of the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 8</div>

<p>And seven days were fulfilled, after
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had smitten the
river.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,
Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Let my people
go, that they may serve me. And if
thou refuse to let them go, behold,
I will smite all thy borders with
frogs: and the river shall bring forth
frogs abundantly, which shall go up
and come into thine house, and into
thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed,
and into the house of thy servants,
and upon thy people, and into thine
ovens, and into thy kneedingtroughs:
and the frogs shall come up both on
thee, and upon thy people, and upon
all thy servants.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine
hand with thy rod over the streams,
over the rivers, and over the ponds,
and cause frogs to come up upon the
land of Egypt. And Aaron stretched
out his hand over the waters of
Egypt; and the frogs came up, and
covered the land of Egypt. And the
magicians did so with their enchantments,
and brought up frogs upon the
land of Egypt.</p>

<p>Then Pharaoh called for Moses
and Aaron, and said, Intreat the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that he may take away the frogs
from me, and from my people; and I
will let the people go, that they may
do sacrifice unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over
me: when shall I intreat for thee, and
for thy servants, and for thy people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to destroy the frogs from thee and
thy houses, that they may remain in
the river only? And he said, To morrow.
And he said, Be it according
to thy word: that thou mayest know
that there is none like unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
our God. And the frogs shall depart
from thee, and from thy houses, and
from thy servants, and from thy people;
they shall remain in the river
only. And Moses and Aaron went
out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> because of the frogs
which he had brought against Pharaoh.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> did according
to the word of Moses; and the frogs
died out of the houses, out of the villages,
and out of the fields. And they
gathered them together upon heaps:

<small>THE PLAGUES OF LICE, FLIES,
MURRAIN, AND BOILS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Exodus 8</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Say unto Aaron, Stretch out
thy rod, and smite the dust of
the land, that it may become lice
throughout all the land of Egypt.
And they did so; for Aaron stretched
out his hand with his rod, and smote
the dust of the earth, and it became
lice in man, and in beast; all the dust
of the land became lice throughout
all the land of Egypt. And the magicians
did so with their enchantments
to bring forth lice, but they could not:
so there were lice upon man, and upon
beast. Then the magicians said unto
Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:
and Pharaoh's heart was hardened,
and he hearkened not unto them; as
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had said.</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Rise
up early in the morning, and stand
before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth
to the water; and say unto him, Thus
saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Let my people go, that
they may serve me. Else, if thou wilt
not let my people go, behold, I will
send swarms of flies upon thee, and
upon thy servants, and upon thy people,
and into thy houses: and the
houses of the Egyptians shall be full
of swarms of flies, and also the
ground whereon they are. And I will
sever in that day the land of Goshen,
in which my people dwell, that no
swarms of flies shall be there; to the
end thou mayest know that I am the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> in the midst of the earth. And
I will put a division between my people
and thy people: to morrow shall
this sign be. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> did so;
and there came a grievous swarm of
flies into the house of Pharaoh, and
into his servants' houses, and into all
the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted
by reason of the swarm of
flies.</p>

<p>And Pharaoh called for Moses and
for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice
to your God in the land. And Moses
said, It is not meet so to do; for we
shall sacrifice the abomination of the
Egyptians to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God: lo,
shall we sacrifice the abomination of
the Egyptians before their eyes, and
will they not stone us? We will go
three days' journey into the wilderness,
and sacrifice to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our
God, as he shall command us. And
Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
ye may sacrifice to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God
in the wilderness; only ye shall not
go very far away: intreat for me.
And Moses said, Behold, I go out
from thee, and I will intreat the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> that the swarms of flies may
depart from Pharaoh, from his servants,
and from his people, to morrow:
but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully
any more in not letting the
people go to sacrifice to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
And Moses went out from Pharaoh,
and intreated the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> did according to the word of
Moses; and he removed the swarms
of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants,
and from his people; there
remained not one. And Pharaoh
hardened his heart at this time also,
neither would he let the people go.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 9</div>

<p>Then the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Go
in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus
saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of the Hebrews,
Let my people go, that they may
serve me. For if thou refuse to let
them go, and wilt hold them still, behold,
the hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is upon
thy cattle which is in the field, upon
the horses, upon the asses, upon the
camels, upon the oxen, and upon the
sheep: there shall be a very grievous
murrain. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall sever
between the cattle of Israel and the
cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing
die of all that is the children's
of Israel. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appointed
a set time, saying, To morrow the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall do this thing in the land.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> did that thing on the
morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt
died: but of the cattle of the children
of Israel died not one. And Pharaoh
sent, and, behold, there was not
one of the cattle of the Israelites dead.
And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
and he did not let the people go.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses and
unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of
ashes of the furnace, and let Moses
sprinkle it toward the heaven in the
sight of Pharaoh. And it shall become
small dust in all the land of
Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking
forth with blains upon man, and upon
beast, throughout all the land of
Egypt. And they took ashes of the
furnace, and stood before Pharaoh;
and Moses sprinkled it up toward
heaven; and it became a boil breaking
forth with blains upon man, and upon
beast. And the magicians could not
stand before Moses because of the
boils; for the boil was upon the magicians,
and upon all the Egyptians.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hardened the heart of
Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto

<small>THE PLAGUE OF HAIL</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Rise up early in the morning,
and stand before Pharaoh,
and say unto him, Thus saith the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of the Hebrews, Let my
people go, that they may serve me.
For I will at this time send all my
plagues upon thine heart, and upon
thy servants, and upon thy people;
that thou mayest know that there is
none like me in all the earth. For
now I will stretch out my hand, that I
may smite thee and thy people with
pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off
from the earth. And in very deed
for this cause have I raised thee up,
for to shew in thee my power; and
that my name may be declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
throughout all the earth. As yet exaltest
thou thyself against my people,
that thou wilt not let them go?</div>

<p>Behold, to morrow about this time
I will cause it to rain a very grievous
hail, such as hath not been in Egypt
since the foundation thereof even
until now. Send therefore now, and
gather thy cattle, and all that thou
hast in the field; for upon every man
and beast which shall be found in the
field, and shall not be brought home,
the hail shall come down upon them,
and they shall die.</p>

<p>He that feared the word of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> among the servants of Pharaoh
made his servants and his cattle
flee into the houses: and he that regarded
not the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> left
his servants and his cattle in the field.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven,
that there may be hail in all the
land of Egypt, upon man, and upon
beast, and upon every herb of the
field, throughout the land of Egypt.
And Moses stretched forth his rod
toward heaven: and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> sent
thunder and hail, and the fire ran
along upon the ground; and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
So there was hail, and fire mingled
with the hail, very grievous, such as
there was none like it in all the land
of Egypt since it became a nation.
And the hail smote throughout all
the land of Egypt all that was in the
field, both man and beast; and the
hail smote every herb of the field, and
brake every tree of the field. Only
in the land of Goshen, where the children
of Israel were, was there no
hail.</p>

<p>And Pharaoh sent, and called for
Moses and Aaron, and said unto
them, I have sinned this time: the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> is righteous, and I and my people
are wicked. Intreat the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> (for
it is enough) that there be no more
mighty thunderings and hail; and I
will let you go, and ye shall stay no
longer. And Moses said unto him,
As soon as I am gone out of the city,
I will spread abroad my hands unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and the thunder shall
cease, neither shall there be any more
hail; that thou mayest know how
that the earth is the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>. But as
for thee and thy servants, I know
that ye will not yet fear the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God.
And the flax and the barley was
smitten: for the barley was in the ear,
and the flax was bolled. But the
wheat and the rie were not smitten:
for they were not grown up. And
Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh,
and spread abroad his hands
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and the thunders and
hail ceased, and the rain was not
poured upon the earth. And when
Pharaoh saw that the rain and the
hail and the thunders were ceased,
he sinned yet more, and hardened
his heart, he and his servants. And
the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
neither would he let the children of
Israel go; as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had spoken
by Moses.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Go in unto Pharaoh: for I

the heart of his servants, that I might
shew these my signs before him: and
that thou mayest tell in the ears of
thy son, and of thy son's son, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
things I have wrought in Egypt, and
my signs which I have done among
them; that ye may know how that I
am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Moses and Aaron
came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto
him, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of the
Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse
to humble thyself before me? let my
people go, that they may serve me.
Else, if thou refuse to let my people
go, behold, to morrow will I bring
the locusts into thy coast: and they
shall cover the face of the earth, that
one cannot be able to see the earth:
and they shall eat the residue of that
which is escaped, which remaineth
unto you from the hail, and shall eat
every tree which groweth for you
out of the field: and they shall fill thy
houses, and the houses of all thy servants,
and the houses of all the Egyptians;
which neither thy fathers, nor
thy fathers' fathers have seen, since
the day that they were upon the earth
unto this day. And he turned himself,
and went out from Pharaoh.</div>

<p>And Pharaoh's servants said unto
him, How long shall this man be a
snare unto us? let the men go, that
they may serve the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> their God:
knowest thou not yet that Egypt is
destroyed? And Moses and Aaron
were brought again unto Pharaoh:
and he said unto them, Go, serve the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God: but who are they that
shall go? And Moses said, We will
go with our young and with our old,
with our sons and with our daughters,
with our flocks and with our herds
will we go; for we must hold a feast
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, Let the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> be so with you, as I will let you
go, and your little ones: look to it;
for evil is before you. Not so: go
now ye that are men, and serve the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>; for that ye did desire. And
they were driven out from Pharaoh's
presence.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Stretch out thine hand over the land
of Egypt for the locusts, that they
may come up upon the land of Egypt,
and eat every herb of the land, even
all that the hail hath left. And Moses
stretched forth his rod over the land
of Egypt, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> brought an
east wind upon the land all that day,
and all that night; and when it was
morning, the east wind brought the
locusts. And the locusts went up
over all the land of Egypt, and rested
in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous
were they; before them there
were no such locusts as they, neither
after them shall be such. For they
covered the face of the whole earth,
so that the land was darkened; and
they did eat every herb of the land,
and all the fruit of the trees which
the hail had left: and there remained
not any green thing in the trees, or in
the herbs of the field, through all the
land of Egypt.</p>

<p>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and
Aaron in haste; and he said, I have
sinned against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God,
and against you. Now therefore forgive,
I pray thee, my sin only this
once, and intreat the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God,
that he may take away from me this
death only. And he went out from
Pharaoh, and intreated the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> turned a mighty strong
west wind, which took away the locusts,
and cast them into the Red sea;
there remained not one locust in all
the coasts of Egypt. But the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he
would not let the children of Israel go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Stretch out thine hand toward heaven,
that there may be darkness over
the land of Egypt, even darkness
which may be felt. And Moses
stretched forth his hand toward heaven;
and there was a thick darkness
in all the land of Egypt three days:
they saw not one another, neither
rose any from his place for three
days: but all the children of Israel
had light in their dwellings.</p>

<p>And Pharaoh called unto Moses,
and said, Go ye, serve the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>;
only let your flocks and your herds be
stayed: let your little ones also go
with you. And Moses said, Thou
must give us also sacrifices and burnt
offerings, that we may sacrifice unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God. Our cattle also
shall go with us; there shall not an
hoof be left behind; for thereof must
we take to serve the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God;

serve the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, until we come thither.</p>

<p>But the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hardened Pharaoh's
heart, and he would not let them go.
And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee

Yet will I bring one plague

Moreover the man Moses was very
great in the land of Egypt, in the

Speak ye unto all the congregation

every man a lamb, according to the

raw, nor sodden at all with water, but
roast with fire; his head with his legs,
and with the purtenance thereof.
And ye shall let nothing of it remain
until the morning; and that which remaineth
of it until the morning ye
shall burn with fire.</p>

<p>And thus shall ye eat it; with your
loins girded, your shoes on your feet,
and your staff in your hand; and ye
shall eat it in haste: it is the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>
passover. For I will pass through
the land of Egypt this night, and will
smite all the firstborn in the land of
Egypt, both man and beast; and
against all the gods of Egypt I will
execute judgment: I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
And the blood shall be to you for a
token upon the houses where ye are:
and when I see the blood, I will pass
over you, and the plague shall not be
upon you to destroy you, when I
smite the land of Egypt. And this
day shall be unto you for a memorial;
and ye shall keep it a feast to
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> throughout your generations;
ye shall keep it a feast by an
ordinance for ever. Seven days shall
ye eat unleavened bread; even the
first day ye shall put away leaven
out of your houses: for whosoever
eateth leavened bread from the first
day until the seventh day, that soul
shall be cut off from Israel. And in
the first day there shall be an holy
convocation, and in the seventh day
there shall be an holy convocation to
you; no manner of work shall be done
in them, save that which every man
must eat, that only may be done of
you. And ye shall observe the feast
of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame
day have I brought your armies
out of the land of Egypt: therefore
shall ye observe this day in your generations
by an ordinance for ever.</p>

<p>In the first month, on the fourteenth
day of the month at even, ye
shall eat unleavened bread, until the
one and twentieth day of the month
at even. Seven days shall there be
no leaven found in your houses: for
whosoever eateth that which is leavened,
even that soul shall be cut off
from the congregation of Israel,
whether he be a stranger, or born in
the land. Ye shall eat nothing leavened;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in all your habitations shall
ye eat unleavened bread.</p>

<p>Then Moses called for all the elders
of Israel, and said unto them, Draw
out and take you a lamb according to
your families, and kill the passover.
And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop,
and dip it in the blood that is in the
bason, and strike the lintel and the
two side posts with the blood that is
in the bason; and none of you shall go
out at the door of his house until the
morning. For the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will pass
through to smite the Egyptians; and
when he seeth the blood upon the lintel,
and on the two side posts, the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> will pass over the door, and will
not suffer the destroyer to come in
unto your houses to smite you.</p>

<p>And ye shall observe this thing for
an ordinance to thee and to thy sons
for ever. And it shall come to pass,
when ye be come to the land which
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will give you, according as
he hath promised, that ye shall keep
this service. And it shall come to
pass, when your children shall say
unto you, What mean ye by this service?
that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice
of the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> passover, who
passed over the houses of the children
of Israel in Egypt, when he
smote the Egyptians, and delivered
our houses. And the people bowed
the head and worshipped. And the
children of Israel went away, and did
as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had commanded Moses
and Aaron, so did they.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, that at midnight
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> smote all the firstborn
in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn
of Pharaoh that sat on his throne
unto the firstborn of the captive that
was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn
of cattle. And Pharaoh rose
up in the night, he, and all his servants,
and all the Egyptians; and
there was a great cry in Egypt; for
there was not a house where there
was not one dead.</p>

<small>THE ISRAELITES GO UP OUT
OF EGYPT</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND Pharaoh called for Moses
and Aaron by night, and said,
Rise up, and get you forth
from among my people, both ye and
the children of Israel; and go, serve
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, as ye have said. Also take
your flocks and your herds, as ye have
said, and be gone; and bless me also.
And the Egyptians were urgent upon
the people, that they might send
them out of the land in haste; for they
said, We be all dead men. And the
people took their dough before it was
leavened, their kneadingtroughs being
bound up in their clothes upon
their shoulders. And the children of
Israel did according to the word of
Moses; and they borrowed of the
Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels
of gold, and raiment: and the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> gave the people favour in the
sight of the Egyptians, so that they
lent unto them such things as they
required. And they spoiled the
Egyptians.</div>

<p>And the children of Israel journeyed
from Rameses to Succoth,
about six hundred thousand on foot
that were men, beside children. And
a mixed multitude went up also with
them; and flocks, and herds, even
very much cattle. And they baked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
unleavened cakes of the dough which
they brought forth out of Egypt, for
it was not leavened; because they
were thrust out of Egypt, and could
not tarry, neither had they prepared
for themselves any victual.</p>

<p>Now the sojourning of the children
of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,
was four hundred and thirty years.
And it came to pass at the end of the
four hundred and thirty years, even
the selfsame day it came to pass, that
all the hosts of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> went out
from the land of Egypt. It is a night
to be much observed unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
for bringing them out from the land
of Egypt: this is that night of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> to be observed of all the children
of Israel in their generations.
And it came to pass the selfsame day,
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> did bring the children
of Israel out of the land of Egypt by
their armies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 13</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, Sanctify unto me all the firstborn
among the children of Israel,
both of man and of beast: it is mine.</p>

<p>And Moses said unto the people,
Remember this day, in which ye came
out from Egypt, out of the house of
bondage; for by strength of hand the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> brought you out from this
place: there shall no leavened bread
be eaten. And it shall be when the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall bring thee into the land
which he sware unto thy fathers to
give thee, a land flowing with milk
and honey, that thou shalt keep this
service in this month. Seven days
thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and
in the seventh day shall be a feast to
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And there shall no leavened
bread be seen with thee, neither
shall there be leaven seen with
thee in all thy quarters. And thou
shalt shew thy son in that day, saying,
This is done because of that
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> did unto me when I
came forth out of Egypt. And it
shall be for a sign unto thee upon
thine hand, and for a memorial between
thine eyes, that the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> law
may be in thy mouth: for with a
strong hand hath the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> brought
thee out of Egypt. Thou shalt therefore
keep this ordinance in his season
from year to year.</p>

<p>And it shall be when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shall bring thee into the land of the
Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and
to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,
that thou shalt set apart unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> every firstling that cometh of
a beast which thou hast; the males
shall be the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>. And every firstling
of an ass thou shalt redeem with
a lamb: and all the firstborn of man
among thy children shalt thou redeem.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_35" id="CHAPTER_35">CHAPTER 35</a><br />

<small>THE OVERWHELMING OF THE
EGYPTIANS</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, when Pharaoh
had let the people go,
that God led them not through
the way of the land of the Philistines,
although that was near; for God said,
Lest peradventure the people repent
when they see war, and they return
to Egypt: but God led the people
about, through the way of the wilderness
of the Red sea: and the children
of Israel went up harnessed out of
the land of Egypt. And Moses took
the bones of Joseph with him: for he
had straitly sworn the children of Israel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
saying, God will surely visit
you; and ye shall carry up my bones
away hence with you.</div>

<p>And they took their journey from
Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in
the edge of the wilderness. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> went before them by day in a
pillar of a cloud, to lead them the
way; and by night in a pillar of fire,
to give them light; to go by day and
night: he took not away the pillar of
the cloud by day, nor the pillar of
fire by night, from before the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 14</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, Speak unto the children of
Israel, that they turn and encamp before
Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and
the sea, over against Baal-zephon:
before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
For Pharaoh will say of the children
of Israel, They are entangled in the
land, the wilderness hath shut them
in. And I will harden Pharaoh's
heart, that he shall follow after them;
and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh,
and upon all his host; that the Egyptians
may know that I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
And they did so.</p>

<p>And it was told the king of Egypt
that the people fled: and the heart of
Pharaoh and of his servants was
turned against the people, and they
said, Why have we done this, that we
have let Israel go from serving us?
And he made ready his chariot, and
took his people with him: and he
took six hundred chosen chariots, and
all the chariots of Egypt, and captains
over every one of them. And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hardened the heart of Pharaoh
king of Egypt, and he pursued
after the children of Israel: and the
children of Israel went out with an
high hand. But the Egyptians pursued
after them, all the horses and
chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen,
and his army, and overtook
them encamping by the sea, beside
Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.</p>

<p>And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the
children of Israel lifted up their
eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians
marched after them; and they were
sore afraid: and the children of Israel
cried out unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
they said unto Moses, Because there
were no graves in Egypt, hast thou
taken us away to die in the wilderness?
wherefore hast thou dealt thus
with us, to carry us forth out of
Egypt? Is not this the word that we
did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us
alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?
For it had been better for us
to serve the Egyptians, than that we
should die in the wilderness. And
Moses said unto the people, Fear ye
not, stand still, and see the salvation
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, which he will shew to
you to day: for the Egyptians whom
ye have seen to day, ye shall see
them again no more for ever. The
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall fight for you, and ye shall
hold your peace.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Wherefore criest thou unto me?
speak unto the children of Israel,
that they go forward: but lift thou up
thy rod, and stretch out thine hand
over the sea, and divide it: and the
children of Israel shall go on dry
ground through the midst of the sea.
And I, behold, I will harden the
hearts of the Egyptians, and they
shall follow them: and I will get me
honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all
his host, upon his chariots, and upon
his horsemen. And the Egyptians
shall know that I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, when
I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
upon his chariots, and upon his
horsemen.</p>

<p>And the angel of God, which went
before the camp of Israel, removed
and went behind them; and the pillar
of the cloud went from before their
face, and stood behind them: and it
came between the camp of the Egyptians
and the camp of Israel; and it
was a cloud and darkness to them,
but it gave light by night to these: so
that the one came not near the other
all the night. And Moses stretched
out his hand over the sea; and the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> caused the sea to go back by a
strong east wind all that night, and
made the sea dry land, and the waters
were divided. And the children of
Israel went into the midst of the sea
upon the dry ground: and the waters
were a wall unto them on their right
hand, and on their left.</p>

<p>And the Egyptians pursued, and
went in after them to the midst of the
sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his
chariots, and his horsemen. And it
came to pass, that in the morning
watch the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> looked unto the host
of the Egyptians through the pillar
of fire and of the cloud, and troubled
the host of the Egyptians, and took
off their chariot wheels, that they
drave them heavily: so that the
Egyptians said, Let us flee from the
face of Israel; for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> fighteth
for them against the Egyptians.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Stretch out thine hand over the sea,
that the waters may come again upon
the Egyptians, upon their chariots,
and upon their horsemen. And Moses
stretched forth his hand over the
sea, and the sea returned to his
strength when the morning appeared;
and the Egyptians fled against it; and
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> overthrew the Egyptians in
the midst of the sea. And the waters
returned, and covered the chariots,
and the horsemen, and all the host of
Pharaoh that came into the sea after
them; there remained not so much as
one of them. But the children of Israel
walked upon dry land in the
midst of the sea; and the waters were
a wall unto them on their right hand,
and on their left. Thus the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
saved Israel that day out of the hand
of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the
Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.
And Israel saw that great work which
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> did upon the Egyptians:
and the people feared the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
believed the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and his servant
Moses.</p>

<small>THE SONG OF MOSES</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Exodus 15</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THEN sang Moses and the
children of Israel this song
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and spake, saying,
I will sing unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, for he
hath triumphed gloriously: the horse
and his rider hath he thrown into
the sea.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is my strength and song,
and he is become my salvation: he is
my God, and I will prepare him an
habitation; my father's God, and I
will exalt him.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is a man of war: the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> is his name.</p>

<p>Pharaoh's chariots and his host
hath he cast into the sea: his chosen
captains also are drowned in the Red
sea.</p>

<p>The depths have covered them:
they sank into the bottom as a stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Thy right hand, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, is become
glorious in power: thy right hand,
O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, hath dashed in pieces the
enemy.</p>

<p>And in the greatness of thine excellency
thou hast overthrown them
that rose up against thee: thou sentest
forth thy wrath, which consumed
them as stubble.</p>

<p>And with the blast of thy nostrils
the waters were gathered together,
the floods stood upright as an heap,
and the depths were congealed in
the heart of the sea.</p>

<p>The enemy said, I will pursue, I
will overtake, I will divide the spoil;
my lust shall be satisfied upon them;
I will draw my sword, my hand shall
destroy them.</p>

<p>Thou didst blow with thy wind, the
sea covered them: they sank as lead
in the mighty waters.</p>

<p>Who is like unto thee, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
among the gods? who is like thee,
glorious in holiness, fearful in
praises, doing wonders?</p>

<p>Thou stretchedst out thy right
hand, the earth swallowed them.</p>

<p>Thou in thy mercy hast led forth
the people which thou hast redeemed:
thou hast guided them in thy strength
unto thy holy habitation.</p>

<p>The people shall hear, and be
afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the
inhabitants of Palestina.</p>

<p>Then the dukes of Edom shall be
amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
trembling shall take hold upon them;
all the inhabitants of Canaan shall
melt away.</p>

<p>Fear and dread shall fall upon
them; by the greatness of thine arm
they shall be as still as a stone; till
thy people pass over, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, till
the people pass over, which thou
hast purchased.</p>

<p>Thou shalt bring them in, and
plant them in the mountain of thine
inheritance, in the place, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
which thou hast made for thee to
dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
which thy hands have established.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall reign for ever and
ever.</p>

<p>For the horse of Pharaoh went in
with his chariots and with his horsemen
into the sea, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
brought again the waters of the sea
upon them; but the children of Israel
went on dry land in the midst of the
sea.</p>

<p>And Miriam the prophetess, the
sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her
hand; and all the women went out
after her with timbrels and with
dances. And Miriam answered them,
Sing ye to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, for he hath triumphed
gloriously; the horse and

<small>THE ISRAELITES FED WITH MANNA</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-s.jpg" width="150" height="171" alt="S" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">SO Moses brought
Israel from the
Red sea, and they
went out into
the wilderness of
Shur; and they
went three days
in the wilderness,
and found no water.
And when they came to Marah,
they could not drink of the waters of
Marah, for they were bitter: therefore
the name of it was called Marah.
And the people murmured against
Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
and he cried unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> shewed him a tree, which when
he had cast into the waters, the waters
were made sweet: there he made
for them a statute and an ordinance,
and there he proved them, and said,
If thou wilt diligently hearken to the
voice of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, and wilt
do that which is right in his sight,
and wilt give ear to his commandments,
and keep all his statutes, I will
put none of these diseases upon thee,
which I have brought upon the Egyptians:
for I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that healeth
thee.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 16</div>

<p>And they came to Elim, where
were twelve wells of water, and threescore
and ten palm trees: and they
encamped there by the waters. And
they took their journey from Elim,
and all the congregation of the children
of Israel came unto the wilderness
of Sin, which is between Elim
and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the
second month after their departing
out of the land of Egypt. And the
whole congregation of the children of
Israel murmured against Moses and
Aaron in the wilderness: and the
children of Israel said unto them,
Would to God we had died by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in the land of
Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots,
and when we did eat bread to the
full; for ye have brought us forth
into this wilderness, to kill this whole
assembly with hunger.</p>

<p>Then said the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> unto Moses,
Behold, I will rain bread from heaven
for you; and the people shall go out
and gather a certain rate every day,
that I may prove them, whether they
will walk in my law, or no. And it
shall come to pass, that on the sixth
day they shall prepare that which
they bring in; and it shall be twice
as much as they gather daily. And
Moses and Aaron said unto all the
children of Israel, At even, then ye
shall know that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath brought
you out from the land of Egypt: and
in the morning, then ye shall see the
glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; for that he heareth
your murmurings against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>:
and what are we, that ye murmur
against us? And Moses said, This
shall be, when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall give
you in the evening flesh to eat, and in
the morning bread to the full; for
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> heareth your murmurings
which ye murmur against him:
and what are we? your murmurings
are not against us, but against the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say
unto all the congregation of the children
of Israel, Come near before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>: for he hath heard your murmurings.
And it came to pass, as
Aaron spake unto the whole congregation
of the children of Israel, that
they looked toward the wilderness,
and, behold, the glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared
in the cloud.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, I have heard the murmurings
of the children of Israel: speak unto
them, saying, At even ye shall eat
flesh, and in the morning ye shall be
filled with bread; and ye shall know
that I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God. And it
came to pass, that at even the quails
came up, and covered the camp: and
in the morning the dew lay round
about the host. And when the dew
that lay was gone up, behold, upon
the face of the wilderness there lay
a small round thing, as small as the
hoar frost on the ground. And when
the children of Israel saw it, they said
one to another, It is manna: for they
wist not what it was. And Moses said
unto them, This is the bread which
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath given you to eat. This
is the thing which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath commanded,
Gather of it every man according
to his eating, an omer for
every man, according to the number
of your persons; take ye every man
for them which are in his tents.</p>

<p>And the children of Israel did so,
and gathered, some more, some less.
And when they did mete it with an
omer, he that gathered much had nothing
over, and he that gathered
little had no lack; they gathered
every man according to his eating.
And Moses said, Let no man leave of
it till the morning. Notwithstanding
they hearkened not unto Moses; but
some of them left of it until the
morning, and it bred worms, and
stank: and Moses was wroth with
them. And they gathered it every
morning, every man according to his
eating: and when the sun waxed hot,
it melted.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, that on the
sixth day they gathered twice as
much bread, two omers for one man:
and all the rulers of the congregation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
came and told Moses. And he said
unto them, This is that which the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath said, To morrow is the
rest of the holy sabbath unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>: bake that which ye will bake to
day, and seethe that ye will seethe;
and that which remaineth over lay
up for you to be kept until the morning.
And they laid it up till the morning,
as Moses bade: and it did not
stink, neither was there any worm
therein. And Moses said, Eat that
to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: to day ye shall not find it
in the field. Six days ye shall gather
it; but on the seventh day, which
is the sabbath, in it there shall be
none.</p>

<div class="caption">MOSES STRIKING THE ROCK, BY MURILLO<br />

<span class='location'>IN LA CARIDAD MUSEUM, SEVILLE</span></div>
</div>

<p>And it came to pass, that there
went out some of the people on the
seventh day for to gather, and they
found none. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto
Moses, How long refuse ye to keep
my commandments and my laws?
See, for that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath given you
the sabbath, therefore he giveth you
on the sixth day the bread of two
days; abide ye every man in his
place, let no man go out of his place
on the seventh day. So the people
rested on the seventh day.</p>

<p>And the house of Israel called the
name thereof Manna: and it was like
coriander seed, white; and the taste
of it was like wafers made with
honey.</p>

<p>And Moses said, This is the thing
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commandeth, Fill an
omer of it to be kept for your generations;
that they may see the bread
wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness,
when I brought you forth
from the land of Egypt. And Moses
said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put
an omer full of manna therein, and
lay it up before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to be kept
for your generations. As the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it
up before the Testimony, to be kept.
And the children of Israel did eat
manna forty years, until they came
to a land inhabited; they did eat
manna, until they came unto the borders
of the land of Canaan.</p>

<small>MOSES BRINGS WATER FROM
THE ROCK&mdash;MOSES AND
HIS FATHER IN LAW</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Exodus 17</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND all the congregation of the
children of Israel journeyed
from the wilderness of Sin,
after their journeys, according to
the commandment of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
pitched in Rephidim: and there was
no water for the people to drink.
Wherefore the people did chide with
Moses, and said, Give us water that
we may drink. And Moses said unto
them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore
do ye tempt the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? And the
people thirsted there for water; and
the people murmured against Moses,
and said, Wherefore is this that thou
hast brought us up out of Egypt, to
kill us and our children and our cattle
with thirst? And Moses cried
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, saying, What shall I
do unto this people? they be almost
ready to stone me. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
said unto Moses, Go on before the
people, and take with thee of the
elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith
thou smotest the river, take in
thine hand, and go. Behold, I will
stand before thee there upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite
the rock, and there shall come water
out of it, that the people may drink.
And Moses did so in the sight of the
elders of Israel. And he called the
name of the place Massah, and Meribah,
because of the chiding of the
children of Israel, and because they
tempted the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, saying, Is the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> among us, or not?</div>

<p>Then came Amalek, and fought
with Israel in Rephidim. And Moses
said unto Joshua, Choose us out men,
and go out, fight with Amalek: to
morrow I will stand on the top of the
hill with the rod of God in mine
hand. So Joshua did as Moses had
said to him, and fought with Amalek:
and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up
to the top of the hill. And it came to
pass, when Moses held up his hand,
that Israel prevailed: and when he
let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
But Moses' hands were heavy; and
they took a stone, and put it under
him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron
and Hur stayed up his hands, the one
on the one side, and the other on the
other side; and his hands were steady
until the going down of the sun. And
Joshua discomfited Amalek and his
people with the edge of the sword.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Write
this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse
it in the ears of Joshua: for I
will utterly put out the remembrance
of Amalek from under heaven. And
Moses built an altar, and called the
name of it Jehovah-nissi: for he said,
Because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath sworn that the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> will have war with Amalek from
generation to generation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 18</div>

<p>When Jethro, the priest of Midian,
Moses' father in law, heard of all that
God had done for Moses, and for Israel
his people, and that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had
brought Israel out of Egypt; then
Jethro, Moses' father in law, took
Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had
sent her back, and her two sons; of
which the name of the one was Gershom;
for he said, I have been an
alien in a strange land: and the name
of the other was Eliezer; for the God
of my father, said he, was mine help,
and delivered me from the sword of
Pharaoh: and Jethro, Moses' father
in law, came with his sons and his
wife unto Moses into the wilderness,
where he encamped at the mount of
God: and he said unto Moses, I thy
father in law Jethro am come unto
thee, and thy wife, and her two sons
with her.</p>

<p>And Moses went out to meet his
father in law, and did obeisance, and
kissed him; and they asked each other
of their welfare; and they came into
the tent. And Moses told his father
in law all that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had done
unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians
for Israel's sake, and all the travail
that had come upon them by the way,
and how the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> delivered them.
And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had done to Israel,
whom he had delivered out of
the hand of the Egyptians. And
Jethro said, Blessed be the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, who
hath delivered you out of the hand of
the Egyptians, and out of the hand of
Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people
from under the hand of the Egyptians.
Now I know that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is
greater than all gods: for in the thing
wherein they dealt proudly he was
above them. And Jethro, Moses'
father in law, took a burnt offering
and sacrifices for God: and Aaron
came, and all the elders of Israel, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
eat bread with Moses' father in law
before God.</p>

<p>And it came to pass on the morrow,
that Moses sat to judge the people:
and the people stood by Moses from
the morning unto the evening. And
when Moses' father in law saw all
that he did to the people, he said,
What is this thing that thou doest to
the people? why sittest thou thyself
alone, and all the people stand by thee
from morning unto even? And
Moses said unto his father in law,
Because the people come unto me to
enquire of God: when they have a
matter, they come unto me; and I
judge between one and another, and
I do make them know the statutes of
God, and his laws. And Moses' father
in law said unto him, The thing
that thou doest is not good. Thou
wilt surely wear away, both thou, and
this people that is with thee: for this
thing is too heavy for thee; thou art
not able to perform it thyself alone.
Hearken now unto my voice, I will
give thee counsel, and God shall be
with thee: Be thou for the people to
God-ward, that thou mayest bring
the causes unto God: and thou shalt
teach them ordinances and laws, and
shalt shew them the way wherein
they must walk, and the work that
they must do. Moreover thou shalt
provide out of all the people able
men, such as fear God, men of truth,
hating covetousness; and place such
over them, to be rulers of thousands,
and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties,
and rulers of tens: and let them
judge the people at all seasons: and
it shall be, that every great matter
they shall bring unto thee, but every
small matter they shall judge: so shall
it be easier for thyself, and they shall
bear the burden with thee. If thou
shalt do this thing, and God command
thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure,
and all this people shall also go
to their place in peace. So Moses
hearkened to the voice of his father in
law, and did all that he had said.
And Moses chose able men out of all
Israel, and made them heads over the
people, rulers of thousands, rulers of
hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers
of tens. And they judged the people
at all seasons: the hard causes they
brought unto Moses, but every small
matter they judged themselves.</p>

<p>And Moses let his father in law
depart; and he went his way into his
own land.</p>

<small>THE LAW GIVEN FROM MOUNT
SINAI</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Exodus 19</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>IN the third month, when the children
of Israel were gone forth
out of the land of Egypt, the
same day came they into the wilderness
of Sinai. For they were departed
from Rephidim, and were
come to the desert of Sinai, and had
pitched in the wilderness; and there
Israel camped before the mount. And
Moses went up unto God, and the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> called unto him out of the mountain,
saying, Thus shalt thou say to
the house of Jacob, and tell the children
of Israel; Ye have seen what
I did unto the Egyptians, and how
I bare you on eagles' wings, and
brought you unto myself. Now therefore,
if ye will obey my voice indeed,
and keep my covenant, then ye shall
be a peculiar treasure unto me above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
all people: for all the earth is mine:
and ye shall be unto me a kingdom
of priests, and an holy nation. These
are the words which thou shalt speak
unto the children of Israel.</div>

<p>And Moses came and called for the
elders of the people, and laid before
their faces all these words which the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded him. And all the
people answered together, and said,
All that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath spoken we will
do. And Moses returned the words
of the people unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Lo, I come
unto thee in a thick cloud, that the
people may hear when I speak with
thee, and believe thee for ever. And
Moses told the words of the people
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Go
unto the people, and sanctify them to
day and to morrow, and let them
wash their clothes, and be ready
against the third day: for the third
day the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will come down in the
sight of all the people upon mount
Sinai. And thou shalt set bounds
unto the people round about, saying,
Take heed to yourselves, that ye go
not up into the mount, or touch the
border of it: whosoever toucheth the
mount shall be surely put to death:
there shall not an hand touch it, but
he shall surely be stoned, or shot
through; whether it be beast or man,
it shall not live: when the trumpet
soundeth long, they shall come up to
the mount.</p>

<p>And Moses went down from the
mount unto the people, and sanctified
the people; and they washed their
clothes. And he said unto the people,
Be ready against the third day.</p>

<p>And it came to pass on the third
day in the morning, that there were
thunders and lightnings, and a thick
cloud upon the mount, and the voice
of the trumpet exceeding loud; so
that all the people that was in the
camp trembled. And Moses brought
forth the people out of the camp to
meet with God; and they stood at the
nether part of the mount. And mount
Sinai was altogether on a smoke,
because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> descended upon it
in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended
as the smoke of a furnace,
and the whole mount quaked greatly.
And when the voice of the trumpet
sounded long, and waxed louder and
louder, Moses spake, and God answered
him by a voice. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
came down upon mount Sinai, on the
top of the mount: and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
called Moses up to the top of the
mount; and Moses went up.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Go
down, charge the people, lest they
break through unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to gaze,
and many of them perish. And let
the priests also, which come near to
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, sanctify themselves, lest
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> break forth upon them. And
Moses said unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, The people
cannot come up to mount Sinai: for
thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds
about the mount, and sanctify it.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto him, Away,
get thee down, and thou shalt come
up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but
let not the priests and the people
break through to come up unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, lest he break forth upon them.
So Moses went down unto the people,
and spake unto them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 20</div>

<p>And God spake all these words,
saying, I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God,
which have brought thee out of the
land of Egypt, out of the house of
bondage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Thou shalt have no other gods
before me.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not make unto thee
any graven image, or any likeness
of any thing that is in heaven above,
or that is in the earth beneath, or
that is in the water under the earth:
thou shalt not bow down thyself to
them, nor serve them: for I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
thy God am a jealous God, visiting
the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children unto the third and fourth
generation of them that hate me;
and shewing mercy unto thousands
of them that love me, and keep my
commandments.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not take the name of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God in vain; for the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> will not hold him guiltless that
taketh his name in vain.</p>

<p>Remember the sabbath day, to keep
it holy. Six days shalt thou labour,
and do all thy work: but the seventh
day is the sabbath of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy
God: in it thou shalt not do any work,
thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter,
thy manservant, nor thy maidservant,
nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that
is within thy gates: for in six days
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> made heaven and earth, the
sea, and all that in them is, and
rested the seventh day: wherefore
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> blessed the sabbath day,
and hallowed it.</p>

<p>Honour thy father and thy mother:
that thy days may be long upon the
land which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God giveth
thee.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not kill.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not steal.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbour.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's
house, thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant,
nor his maidservant, nor his
ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is
thy neighbour's.</p>

<p>And all the people saw the thunderings,
and the lightnings, and the
noise of the trumpet, and the mountain
smoking: and when the people
saw it, they removed, and stood afar
off. And they said unto Moses,
Speak thou with us, and we will
hear: but let not God speak with us,
lest we die. And Moses said unto
the people, Fear not: for God is
come to prove you, and that his fear
may be before your faces, that ye sin
not. And the people stood afar off,
and Moses drew near unto the thick
darkness where God was.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Thus thou shalt say unto the children
of Israel, Ye have seen that I have
talked with you from heaven. Ye
shall not make with me gods of silver,
neither shall ye make unto you gods
of gold. An altar of earth thou shalt
make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy
peace offerings, thy sheep, and
thine oxen: in all places where I
record my name I will come unto
thee, and I will bless thee.</p>

<small>MOSES CALLED UP INTO THE

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 24</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND he said unto Moses, Come
up unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, thou, and
Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu,
and seventy of the elders of Israel;
and worship ye afar off. And Moses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
alone shall come near the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: but
they shall not come nigh; neither
shall the people go up with him.</div>

<p>And Moses came and told the
people all the words of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and all the judgments: and all the
people answered with one voice, and
said, All the words which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
hath said will we do. And Moses
wrote all the words of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and rose up early in the morning,
and builded an altar under the hill,
and twelve pillars, according to the
twelve tribes of Israel. And he sent
young men of the children of Israel,
which offered burnt offerings, and
sacrificed peace offerings of oxen
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Moses took half
of the blood, and put it in basons; and
half of the blood he sprinkled on the
altar. And he took the book of the
covenant, and read in the audience
of the people: and they said, All that
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath said will we do, and be
obedient. And Moses took the blood,
and sprinkled it on the people, and
said, Behold the blood of the covenant,
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath made with
you concerning all these words.</p>

<p>Then went up Moses, and Aaron,
Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of
the elders of Israel: and they saw the
God of Israel: and there was under
his feet as it were a paved work of a
sapphire stone, and as it were the
body of heaven in his clearness. And
upon the nobles of the children of Israel
he laid not his hand: also they
saw God, and did eat and drink.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Come up to me into the mount, and be
there: and I will give thee tables of
stone, and a law, and commandments
which I have written; that thou mayest
teach them. And Moses rose up,
and his minister Joshua: and Moses
went up into the mount of God. And
he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here
for us, until we come again unto you:
and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with
you: if any man have any matters to
do, let him come unto them. And
Moses went up into the mount, and a
cloud covered the mount. And the
glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> abode upon mount
Sinai, and the cloud covered it six
days: and the seventh day he called
unto Moses out of the midst of the
cloud. And the sight of the glory of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was like devouring fire on
the top of the mount in the eyes of the
children of Israel. And Moses went
into the midst of the cloud, and gat
him up into the mount: and Moses
was in the mount forty days and forty
nights.</p>

<small>THE TABERNACLE AND THE
PRIESTHOOD</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Exodus 25</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded Moses
to tell the children of Israel
to bring him offerings of gold,
and silver, and brass, of blue, and
purple, and scarlet, and fine linen,
of rams' skins, and badgers' skins,
and shittim wood, oil, spices, and
sweet incense, and stones to be set in
the priests' garments.</div>

<p>And they were to make an ark of
shittim wood overlaid with gold, with
gold rings in the four corners, and
staves to put in the rings to bear it
with: and in the ark they were to put
the testimony which God should give
them.</p>

<p>And they were to make a mercy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
seat of pure gold, with two cherubims,
one on each end, with their
faces looking toward each other, and
their wings stretched out over the
mercy seat. And the mercy seat was
to rest upon the ark.</p>

<p>And God said, There I will meet
with thee, and I will commune with
thee from above the mercy seat, from
between the two cherubims which are
upon the ark of the testimony, of all
things which I will give thee in
commandment unto the children of
Israel.</p>

<p>And they were to make a table of
shittim wood overlaid with gold, with
rings and staves to bear it, and dishes
and spoons of pure gold: and on the
table was to be set the shewbread before
God alway. And they were to
make a candlestick of pure gold, with
six branches coming out of the sides
of it, three branches on each side: and
its seven lamps were to be kept
lighted. And there were to be tongs
and snuffdishes of pure gold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 26</div>

<p>And the tabernacle was to be made
with ten curtains of fine twined linen,
and blue, and purple, and scarlet,
fastened with loops of blue and gold.
And over these were to be eleven
curtains of goats' hair, and these
were to be covered with rams' skins
dyed red, and over these a covering
of badgers' skins. And the boards
and bars for the tabernacle were to
be made of shittim wood overlaid
with gold, with fastenings of silver.
And they were to make a vail of fine
twined linen, and hang it upon four
pillars of shittim wood, to divide between
the holy place and the most
holy. And the ark of the testimony
was to be brought within the vail, and
the mercy seat put upon it in the
most holy place. But the table and
the candlestick were to be without the
vail.</p>

<p>And the hanging for the door of
the tent was to be of blue, and purple,
and scarlet, and fine twined linen,
wrought with needlework.</p>

<p>And they were to make an altar of
shittim wood, with horns on the corners,
and staves to bear it, and to
overlay it all with brass, and to make
vessels of brass for the altar.</p>

<p>And the tabernacle was to have a
court round about it, enclosed by
linen curtains hung on pillars of
brass. And the gate of the court was
to be hung with blue, and purple,
and scarlet, and fine twined linen,
wrought with needlework.</p>

<p>And the children of Israel were
commanded to bring pure oil olive
beaten for the light, to cause the lamp
to burn always. And Aaron and his
sons were to order it from evening to
morning before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>And Aaron and his sons were to
minister unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in the priest's
office. And Moses was commanded
to make holy garments for them; an
ephod of blue, and purple, and scarlet,
and fine twined linen, and on the
shoulders of the ephod were to be two
onyx stones, with the names of the
children of Israel graven on them: six
of their names on one stone, and the
other six names on the other stone,
according to their birth. And they
were to make the breastplate of judgment
with four rows of stones set in
it: the first row a sardius, a topaz,
and a carbuncle; the second row an
emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;
the third row a ligure, an agate, and
an amethyst; and the fourth row a
beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
And the names of the twelve tribes of
the children of Israel were to be engraved
on the stones. And God said
unto Moses, And Aaron shall bear the
names of the children of Israel in the
breastplate of judgment upon his
heart, when he goeth in unto the holy
place, for a memorial before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> continually.</p>

<p>And the robe of the ephod was to
be made of blue, and upon the hem of
it pomegranates of blue, and purple,
and scarlet, and golden bells between
the pomegranates.</p>

<p>And God said, Thou shalt make a
plate of pure gold, and grave upon it,
like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS
TO THE LORD. And
thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that
it may be upon the mitre; upon the
forefront of the mitre it shall be.
And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead.
And for Aaron's sons thou
shalt make coats, and thou shalt make
for them girdles, and bonnets shalt
thou make for them, for glory and for
beauty. And thou shalt put them
upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons
with him; and shalt anoint them, and
consecrate them, and sanctify them,
that they may minister unto me in the
priest's office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 29</div>

<p>And they were to offer upon the
altar two lambs of the first year day
by day; one lamb in the morning, and
the other lamb at even; to be a continual
burnt offering at the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>And God said, There I will meet
with the children of Israel, and the
tabernacle shall be sanctified by my
glory. And I will sanctify the tabernacle
of the congregation, and the
altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron
and his sons, to minister to me in the
priest's office.</p>

<p>And I will dwell among the children
of Israel, and will be their God.
And they shall know that I am the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> their God, that brought them
forth out of the land of Egypt, that
I may dwell among them: I am the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> their God.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, When thou takest the sum of
the children of Israel after their
number, then shall they give every
man a ransom for his soul unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, when thou numberest them;
that there be no plague among them,
when thou numberest them. This
they shall give, every one that passeth
among them that are numbered,
half a shekel after the shekel of the
sanctuary: an half shekel shall be
the offering of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Every one
that passeth among them that are
numbered, from twenty years old
and above, shall give an offering
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. The rich shall not
give more, and the poor shall not
give less than half a shekel, when
they give an offering unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
to make an atonement for your souls.
And thou shalt take the atonement
money of the children of Israel,
and shalt appoint it for the service
of the tabernacle of the congregation;
that it may be a memorial unto
the children of Israel before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to make an atonement for your
souls.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, See, I have called by name
Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of
Hur, of the tribe of Judah: and I
have filled him with the spirit of God,
in wisdom, and in understanding,
and in knowledge, and in all manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of workmanship, to devise cunning
works, to work in gold, and in silver,
and in brass, and in cutting of stones,
to set them, and in carving of timber,
to work in all manner of workmanship.
And I, behold, I have given
with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach,
of the tribe of Dan: and in the
hearts of all that are wise hearted I
have put wisdom, that they may make
all that I have commanded thee.
And he gave unto Moses, when he
had made an end of communing with
him upon mount Sinai, two tables of
testimony, tables of stone, written
with the finger of God.</p>

out of the mount, the people
gathered themselves together unto
Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make
us gods, which shall go before us; for
as for this Moses, the man that
brought us up out of the land of
Egypt, we wot not what is become of
him. And Aaron said unto them,
Break off the golden earrings, which
are in the ears of your wives, of
your sons, and of your daughters, and
bring them unto me. And all the
people brake off the golden earrings
which were in their ears, and brought
them unto Aaron. And he received
them at their hand, and fashioned it
with a graving tool, after he had
made it a molten calf: and they said,
These be thy gods, O Israel, which
brought thee up out of the land of
Egypt. And when Aaron saw it, he
built an altar before it; and Aaron
made proclamation, and said, To
morrow is a feast to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
they rose up early on the morrow,
and offered burnt offerings, and
brought peace offerings; and the
people sat down to eat and to drink,
and rose up to play.</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Go,
get thee down; for thy people, which
thou broughtest out of the land of
Egypt, have corrupted themselves:
they have turned aside quickly out of
the way which I commanded them:
they have made them a molten calf,
and have worshipped it, and have
sacrificed thereunto, and said, These
be thy gods, O Israel, which have
brought thee up out of the land of
Egypt.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, I
have seen this people, and, behold, it
is a stiffnecked people: now therefore
let me alone, that my wrath may wax
hot against them, and that I may consume
them: and I will make of thee a
great nation. And Moses besought
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God, and said, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, why
doth thy wrath wax hot against thy
people, which thou hast brought forth
out of the land of Egypt with
great power, and with a mighty
hand? Wherefore should the Egyptians
speak, and say, For mischief
did he bring them out, to slay them in
the mountains, and to consume them
from the face of the earth? Turn
from thy fierce wrath, and repent of
this evil against thy people. Remember
Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy
servants, to whom thou swarest by
thine own self, and saidst unto them,
I will multiply your seed as the stars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of heaven, and all this land that I
have spoken of will I give unto your
seed, and they shall inherit it for
ever. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> repented of the
evil which he thought to do unto his
people.</p>

<p>And Moses turned, and went down
from the mount, and the two tables of
the testimony were in his hand: the
tables were written on both their
sides; on the one side and on the
other were they written. And the tables
were the work of God, and the
writing was the writing of God,
graven upon the tables.</p>

<p>And when Joshua heard the noise
of the people as they shouted, he said
unto Moses, There is a noise of war
in the camp. And he said, It is not
the voice of them that shout for mastery,
neither is it the voice of them
that cry for being overcome: but the
noise of them that sing do I hear.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, as soon as he
came nigh unto the camp, that he saw
the calf, and the dancing: and Moses'
anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables
out of his hands, and brake them
beneath the mount. And he took the
calf which they had made, and burnt
it in the fire, and ground it to powder,
and strawed it upon the water, and
made the children of Israel drink of
it.</p>

<p>And Moses said unto Aaron, What
did this people unto thee, that thou
hast brought so great a sin upon
them?</p>

<p>And Aaron said, Let not the anger
of my <span class="smcap">Lord</span> wax hot: thou knowest
the people, that they are set on mischief.
For they said unto me, Make
us gods, which shall go before us: for
as for this Moses, the man that
brought us up out of the land of
Egypt, we wot not what is become of
him. And I said unto them, Whosoever
hath any gold, let them break it
off. So they gave it me: then I cast
it into the fire, and there came out this
calf.</p>

<p>Then Moses stood in the gate of the
camp, and said, Who is on the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>
side? let him come unto me. And all
the sons of Levi gathered themselves
together unto him. And he said unto
them, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel,
Put every man his sword by his
side, and go in and out from gate to
gate throughout the camp, and slay
every man his brother, and every
man his companion, and every man
his neighbour. And the children of
Levi did according to the word of
Moses: and there fell of the people
that day about three thousand men.
For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves
to day to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, even every
man upon his son, and upon his
brother; that he may bestow upon
you a blessing this day.</p>

<p>And it came to pass on the morrow,
that Moses said unto the people,
Ye have sinned a great sin: and now
I will go up unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; peradventure
I shall make an atonement
for your sin.</p>

<p>And Moses returned unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and said, Oh, this people have sinned
a great sin, and have made them gods
of gold. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive
their sin&mdash;; and if not, blot me, I
pray thee, out of thy book which thou
hast written.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Whosoever hath sinned against me,
him will I blot out of my book.
Therefore now go, lead the people
unto the place of which I have spoken
unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
go before thee: nevertheless in the
day when I visit I will visit their sin
upon them. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> plagued
the people, because they made the
calf, which Aaron made.</p>

<small>THE SECOND SET OF TABLES</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Exodus 33</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Depart, and go up hence, thou
and the people which thou
hast brought up out of the land of
Egypt, unto a land flowing with milk
and honey: for I will not go up in the
midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked
people: lest I consume thee in
the way.</div>

<p>And when the people heard these
evil tidings, they mourned: and no
man did put on him his ornaments.</p>

<p>And Moses took the tabernacle,
and pitched it without the camp, afar
off from the camp, and called it the
Tabernacle of the congregation. And
it came to pass, that every one which
sought the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> went out unto the
tabernacle of the congregation, which
was without the camp. And it came
to pass, when Moses went out unto the
tabernacle, that all the people rose
up, and stood every man at his tent
door, and looked after Moses, until he
was gone into the tabernacle. And it
came to pass, as Moses entered into
the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended,
and stood at the door of the
tabernacle, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> talked with
Moses. And all the people saw the
cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle
door: and all the people rose up and
worshipped, every man in his tent
door. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto
Moses face to face, as a man speaketh
unto his friend. And he turned
again into the camp: but his servant
Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man,
departed not out of the tabernacle.</p>

<p>And Moses said unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, See,
thou sayest unto me, Bring up this
people: and thou hast not let me know
whom thou wilt send with me. Yet
thou hast said, I know thee by name,
and thou hast also found grace in my
sight. Now therefore, I pray thee,
if I have found grace in thy sight,
shew me now thy way, that I may
know thee, that I may find grace in
thy sight: and consider that this nation
is thy people.</p>

<p>And he said, My presence shall go
with thee, and I will give thee rest.</p>

<p>And he said unto him, If thy presence
go not with me, carry us not
up hence. For wherein shall it be
known here that I and thy people
have found grace in thy sight? is it
not in that thou goest with us? so
shall we be separated, I and thy people,
from all the people that are upon
the face of the earth.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, I
will do this thing also that thou hast
spoken: for thou hast found grace in
my sight, and I know thee by name.</p>

<p>And he said, I beseech thee, shew
me thy glory.</p>

<p>And he said, I will make all my
goodness pass before thee, and I will
proclaim the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> before
thee; and will be gracious to whom I
will be gracious, and will shew mercy
on whom I will shew mercy. And he
said, Thou canst not see my face: for
there shall no man see me, and live.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said, Behold, there
is a place by me, and thou shalt stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
upon a rock: and it shall come to
pass, while my glory passeth by, that
I will put thee in a clift of the rock,
and will cover thee with my hand
while I pass by: and I will take
away mine hand, and thou shalt see
my back: but my face shall not be
seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus 34</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Hew thee two tables of stone like
unto the first: and I will write upon
these tables the words that were in the
first tables, which thou brakest. And
be ready in the morning, and come up
in the morning unto mount Sinai, and
present thyself there to me in the top
of the mount. And no man shall
come up with thee, neither let any
man be seen throughout all the
mount; neither let the flocks nor
herds feed before that mount.</p>

<p>And he hewed two tables of stone
like unto the first; and Moses rose up
early in the morning, and went up
unto mount Sinai, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had
commanded him, and took in his hand
the two tables of stone. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> descended in the cloud, and
stood with him there, and proclaimed
the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the
LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed,
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God,
merciful and gracious, longsuffering,
and abundant in goodness and truth,
keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity and transgression and
sin, and that will by no means clear
the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children, and upon
the children's children, unto the third
and to the fourth generation.</p>

<p>And Moses made haste, and bowed
his head toward the earth, and worshipped.
And he said, If now I have
found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let
my <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I pray thee, go among us;
for it is a stiffnecked people; and
pardon our iniquity and our sin, and
take us for thine inheritance.</p>

<p>And he said, Behold, I make a covenant:
before all thy people I will do
marvels, such as have not been done
in all the earth, nor in any nation:
and all the people among which thou
art shall see the work of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
Take heed to thyself, lest thou make
a covenant with the inhabitants of the
land whither thou goest, lest it be for
a snare in the midst of thee: but ye
shall destroy their altars, break their
images, and cut down their groves:
for thou shalt worship no other god:
for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, whose name is Jealous,
is a jealous God.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Write thou these words: for after
the tenor of these words I have made
a covenant with thee and with Israel.
And he was there with the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
forty days and forty nights; he did
neither eat bread, nor drink water.
And he wrote upon the tables the
words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Moses
came down from mount Sinai with
the two tables of testimony in Moses'
hand, when he came down from the
mount, that Moses wist not that the
skin of his face shone while he talked
with him. And when Aaron and all
the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,
the skin of his face shone; and
they were afraid to come nigh him.
And Moses called unto them; and
Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation
returned unto him: and
Moses talked with them. And afterward
all the children of Israel came
nigh: and he gave them in commandment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
all that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had spoken
with him in mount Sinai.</p>

<p>And till Moses had done speaking
with them, he put a vail on his face.
But when Moses went in before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> to speak with him, he took the
vail off, until he came out. And he
came out, and spake unto the children
of Israel that which he was commanded.
And the children of Israel
saw the face of Moses, that the skin
of Moses' face shone: and Moses put
the vail upon his face again, until he
went in to speak with him.</p>

<small>THE SETTING UP OF THE
TABERNACLE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Exodus 35</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Moses spake unto all the
congregation of the children
of Israel, saying, This is the
thing which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded,
saying, Take ye from among you an
offering unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: whosoever is
of a willing heart, let him bring it,
an offering of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</div>

<p>And all the congregation of the
children of Israel departed from the
presence of Moses. And they came,
every one whose heart stirred him up,
and every one whom his spirit made
willing, and they brought the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>
offering to the work of the tabernacle
of the congregation, and for all his
service, and for the holy garments.
And all the women that were wise
hearted did spin with their hands, and
brought that which they had spun.
And all the women whose heart
stirred them up in wisdom spun
goats' hair. And the rulers brought
onyx stones, and stones for the ephod,
and for the breastplate; and spice,
and oil for the light, and for the
anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.</p>

<p>Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab,
and every wise hearted man, in
whom the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> put wisdom and understanding
to know how to work all
manner of work for the service of the
sanctuary, according to all that the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> had commanded. And they received
of Moses all the offering,
which the children of Israel had
brought for the work of the service of
the sanctuary, to make it withal.
And they brought yet unto him free
offerings every morning.</p>

<p>And they spake unto Moses, saying,
The people bring much more
than enough for the service of the
work, which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded to
make.</p>

<p>And Moses gave commandment,
and they caused it to be proclaimed
throughout the camp, saying, Let
neither man nor woman make any
more work for the offering of the
sanctuary. So the people were restrained
from bringing. For the
stuff they had was sufficient for all
the work to make it, and too much.</p>

<p>Thus was all the work of the tabernacle
of the tent of the congregation
finished: and the children of Israel
did according to all that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
commanded Moses, so did they. And
Moses did look upon all the work,
and, behold, they had done it as the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> had commanded, even so had
they done it: and Moses blessed them.</p>

<p>And it came to pass in the first
month in the second year, on the first
day of the month, that the tabernacle
was reared up. Then a cloud covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the tent of the congregation, and the
glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> filled the tabernacle.
And Moses was not able to
enter into the tent of the congregation,
because the cloud abode thereon,
and the glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> filled the
tabernacle. And when the cloud was
taken up from over the tabernacle,
the children of Israel went onward
in all their journeys: but if the
cloud were not taken up, then they
journeyed not till the day that it was
taken up. For the cloud of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
was upon the tabernacle by day, and
fire was on it by night, in the sight of
all the house of Israel, throughout all
their journeys.</p>

<p>And Moses consecrated Aaron and
his sons, as God had commanded; and
Aaron and his sons did all things
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded through
Moses.</p>

<p>And Aaron lifted up his hand toward
the people, and blessed them,
and came down from offering of the
sin offering, and the burnt offering,
and peace offerings. And Moses and
Aaron went into the tabernacle of the
congregation, and came out, and
blessed the people: and the glory of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared unto all the people.
And there came a fire out from
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and consumed upon
the altar the burnt offering and the
fat: which when all the people saw,
they shouted, and fell on their faces.</p>

<p>And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of
Aaron, took either of them his censer,
and put fire therein, and put incense
thereon, and offered strange fire before
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, which he commanded
them not. And there went out fire
from the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and devoured them,
and they died before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Then
Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that
the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified
in them that come nigh me, and
before all the people I will be glorified.
And Aaron held his peace.</p>

<small>THE DAY OF ATONEMENT</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Leviticus 16</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses
after the death of the two sons
of Aaron, when they offered
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and died; and the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Speak unto
Aaron thy brother, that he come not
at all times into the holy place within
the vail before the mercy seat, which
is upon the ark; that he die not: for
I will appear in the cloud upon the
mercy seat. Thus shall Aaron come
into the holy place: with a young bullock
for a sin offering, and a ram
for a burnt offering. He shall put
on the holy linen coat, and he shall
have the linen breeches upon his
flesh, and shall be girded with a linen
girdle, and with the linen mitre shall
he be attired: these are holy garments;
therefore shall he wash his
flesh in water, and so put them on.
And he shall take of the congregation
of the children of Israel two kids of
the goats for a sin offering, and one
ram for a burnt offering. And Aaron
shall offer his bullock of the sin offering,
which is for himself, and make
an atonement for himself, and for his
house. And he shall take the two
goats, and present them before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> at the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation. And Aaron shall
cast lots upon the two goats; one lot
for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and the other lot for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
scapegoat. And Aaron shall bring
the goat upon which the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> lot
fell, and offer him for a sin offering.
But the goat, on which the lot fell to
be the scapegoat, shall be presented
alive before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to make an
atonement with him, and to let him
go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.
And Aaron shall bring the
bullock of the sin offering, which is
for himself, and shall make an atonement
for himself, and for his house,
and shall kill the bullock of the sin
offering which is for himself: and he
shall take a censer full of burning
coals of fire from off the altar before
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and his hands full of sweet
incense beaten small, and bring it
within the vail: and he shall put the
incense upon the fire before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
that the cloud of the incense may
cover the mercy seat that is upon the
testimony, that he die not: and he
shall take of the blood of the bullock,
and sprinkle it with his finger upon
the mercy seat eastward; and before
the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the
blood with his finger seven times.</div>

<p>Then shall he kill the goat of the
sin offering, that is for the people,
and bring his blood within the vail,
and do with that blood as he did with
the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle
it upon the mercy seat, and before
the mercy seat: and he shall make an
atonement for the holy place, because
of the uncleanness of the children of
Israel, and because of their transgressions
in all their sins: and so shall
he do for the tabernacle of the congregation,
that remaineth among
them in the midst of their uncleanness.
And there shall be no man in
the tabernacle of the congregation
when he goeth in to make an atonement
in the holy place, until he come
out, and have made an atonement for
himself, and for his household, and
for all the congregation of Israel.
And he shall go out unto the altar
that is before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and make an
atonement for it; and shall take of
the blood of the bullock, and of the
blood of the goat, and put it upon the
horns of the altar round about. And
he shall sprinkle of the blood upon
it with his finger seven times, and
cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness
of the children of Israel.
And when he hath made an end of
reconciling the holy place, and the
tabernacle of the congregation, and
the altar, he shall bring the live goat:
and Aaron shall lay both his hands
upon the head of the live goat, and
confess over him all the iniquities of
the children of Israel, and all their
transgressions in all their sins, putting
them upon the head of the goat,
and shall send him away by the hand
of a fit man into the wilderness: and
the goat shall bear upon him all their
iniquities unto a land not inhabited:
and he shall let go the goat in the
wilderness.</p>

offering made by fire unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
seven days: in the seventh day is an
holy convocation: ye shall do no servile
work therein.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, Speak unto the children of Israel,
and say unto them, When ye be
come into the land which I give unto
you, and shall reap the harvest thereof,
then ye shall bring a sheaf of the
firstfruits of your harvest unto the
priest: and he shall wave the sheaf
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to be accepted for
you: on the morrow after the sabbath
the priest shall wave it. And ye shall
offer that day when ye wave the
sheaf an he lamb without blemish of
the first year for a burnt offering
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And ye shall eat
neither bread, nor parched corn, nor
green ears, until the selfsame day
that ye have brought an offering
unto your God: it shall be a statute
for ever throughout your generations
in all your dwellings.</p>

<p>And ye shall count unto you from
the morrow after the sabbath, from
the day that ye brought the sheaf of
the wave offering; seven sabbaths
shall be complete: even unto the morrow
after the seventh sabbath shall
ye number fifty days; and ye shall
offer a new meat offering unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>In the seventh month, in the first
day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath,
a memorial of blowing of trumpets.
Ye shall do no servile work
therein: but ye shall offer an offering
made by fire unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>Also on the tenth day of this seventh
month there shall be a day of
atonement; and ye shall afflict your
souls, and offer an offering made by
fire unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And ye shall do
no work in that same day: for it is a
day of atonement, to make an atonement
for you before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your
God. Also in the fifteenth day of the
seventh month, when ye have gathered
in the fruit of the land, ye shall
keep a feast unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> seven
days: on the first day shall be a sabbath,
and on the eighth day shall be
a sabbath. And ye shall take you on
the first day the boughs of goodly
trees, branches of palm trees, and the
boughs of thick trees, and willows of
the brook; and ye shall rejoice before
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God seven days. And
ye shall keep it a feast unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
seven days in the year. It shall be a
statute for ever in your generations:
ye shall celebrate it in the seventh
month. Ye shall dwell in booths
seven days; all that are Israelites
born shall dwell in booths: that your
generations may know that I made
the children of Israel to dwell in
booths, when I brought them out of
the land of Egypt: I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
your God. And Moses declared unto
the children of Israel the feasts of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leviticus 24</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,

that they bring unto thee pure
oil olive beaten for the light, to cause
the lamps to burn continually.</p>

<p>And thou shalt take fine flour, and
bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth
deals shall be in one cake. And thou
shalt set them in two rows, six on a
row, upon the pure table before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And thou shalt put pure
frankincense upon each row, that it
may be on the bread for a memorial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
even an offering made by fire unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>Every sabbath he shall set it in
order before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> continually,
being taken from the children of Israel
by an everlasting covenant. And
it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and
they shall eat it in the holy place: for
it is most holy unto him of the offerings

<small>THE SEVENTH YEAR AND THE
YEAR OF JUBILE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Leviticus 25</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses
in mount Sinai, saying, Speak
unto the children of Israel,
and say unto them, When ye come
into the land which I give you, then
shall the land keep a sabbath unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Six years thou shalt sow thy
field, and six years thou shalt prune
thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit
thereof; but in the seventh year shall
be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a
sabbath for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: thou shalt neither
sow thy field, nor prune thy
vineyard. That which groweth of its
own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
not reap, neither gather the grapes of
thy vine undressed: for it is a year of
rest unto the land. And ye shall hallow
the fiftieth year, and proclaim
liberty throughout all the land unto
all the inhabitants thereof: it shall
be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return
every man unto his possession,
and ye shall return every man unto
his family. Ye shall not sow, neither
reap that which groweth of itself in
it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy
vine undressed. For it is the jubile;
it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat
the increase thereof out of the field.</div>

<p>The land shall not be sold for ever:
for the land is mine; for ye are strangers
and sojourners with me. And
if thy brother that dwelleth by thee
be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee;
thou shalt not compel him to serve as
a bondservant: but as an hired servant,
and as a sojourner, he shall be
with thee, and shall serve thee unto
the year of jubile: and then shall he
depart from thee, both he and his
children with him, and shall return
unto his own family, and unto the
possession of his fathers shall he return.
For unto me the children of
Israel are servants; they are my servants
whom I brought forth out of the
land of Egypt: I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your
God.</p>

<p>If ye walk in my statutes, and keep
my commandments, and do them;
then I will give you rain in due season,
and the land shall yield her increase,
and the trees of the field shall
yield their fruit. And your threshing
shall reach unto the vintage, and the
vintage shall reach unto the sowing
time: and ye shall eat your bread to
the full, and dwell in your land safely.
And I will give peace in the land,
and ye shall lie down, and none shall
make you afraid: and I will rid evil
beasts out of the land, neither shall
the sword go through your land.
And ye shall chase your enemies, and
they shall fall before you by the
sword. And I will walk among you,
and will be your God, and ye shall be
my people. But if ye will not
hearken unto me, and will not do all
these commandments, but break my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
covenant: I will set my face against
you, and ye shall be slain before
your enemies: they that hate you
shall reign over you; and ye shall
flee when none pursueth you. And if
ye will not yet for all this hearken
unto me, then I will punish you seven
times more for your sins. And I will
break the pride of your power; and
I will make your heaven as iron,
and your earth as brass: and your
strength shall be spent in vain: for
your land shall not yield her increase,
neither shall the trees of the land
yield their fruits. And ye shall perish
among the heathen, and the land
of your enemies shall eat you up.
And they that are left of you shall
pine away in their iniquity in your
enemies' lands.</p>

<p>If they shall confess their iniquity,
and the iniquity of their fathers, with
their trespass which they trespassed
against me, and that also they have
walked contrary unto me: then will I
remember my covenant with Jacob,
and also my covenant with Isaac, and
also my covenant with Abraham will
I remember; and I will remember the
land. And yet for all that, when they
be in the land of their enemies, I will
not cast them away, neither will I
abhor them, to destroy them utterly,
and to break my covenant with them:
for I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> their God. But I
will for their sakes remember the
covenant of their ancestors, whom I
brought forth out of the land of
Egypt in the sight of the heathen,
that I might be their God: I am the

<small>THE NUMBERING OF THE PEOPLE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Numbers 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses
in the wilderness of Sinai, in
the tabernacle of the congregation,
on the first day of the second
month, in the second year after they
were come out of the land of Egypt,
saying, Take ye the sum of all the
congregation of the children of Israel,
after their families, by the
house of their fathers, with the number
of their names, every male by
their polls; from twenty years old
and upward, all that are able to go
forth to war in Israel: thou and
Aaron shall number them by their
armies.</div>

<p>And Moses and Aaron assembled
all the congregation together on the
first day of the second month. And
as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded Moses, so he
numbered them in the wilderness of
Sinai, every male from twenty years
old and upward, all that were able to
go forth to war. All they that were
numbered were six hundred thousand
and three thousand and five hundred
and fifty.</p>

<p>But the Levites after the tribe of
their fathers were not numbered
among them. For the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had
spoken unto Moses, saying, Only thou
shalt not number the tribe of Levi,
neither take the sum of them among
the children of Israel: but thou
shalt appoint the Levites over the
tabernacle of testimony, and over all
the vessels thereof, and over all
things that belong to it: they shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels
thereof; and they shall minister
unto it, and shall encamp round about
the tabernacle.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, Bring the tribe of Levi near,
and present them before Aaron the
priest, that they may minister unto
him. And thou shalt give the Levites
unto Aaron and to his sons: they are
wholly given unto him out of the children
of Israel. And thou shalt appoint
Aaron and his sons, and they
shall wait on their priest's office: and
the stranger that cometh nigh shall
be put to death.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, And I, behold, I have taken
the Levites from among the children
of Israel instead of all the firstborn
among the children of Israel: therefore
the Levites shall be mine; because
all the firstborn are mine; for
on the day that I smote all the firstborn
in the land of Egypt I hallowed
unto me all the firstborn in Israel,
both man and beast: mine shall they
be: I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses in
the wilderness of Sinai, saying, Number
the children of Levi after the
house of their fathers, by their families:
every male from a month old
and upward shalt thou number them.
And Moses numbered them according
to the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, as he was
commanded.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, Speak unto Aaron and unto

<small>THE OFFERINGS OF THE PRINCES&mdash;THE
CHILDREN OF ISRAEL
JOURNEY</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Numbers 7</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass on the day
that Moses had fully set up the
tabernacle, and had anointed
it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments
thereof, both the altar and
all the vessels thereof, and had anointed
them, and sanctified them;
that the princes of Israel, heads of
the house of their fathers, who were
the princes of the tribes, and were
over them that were numbered, offered:
and they brought their offering
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, six covered wagons,
and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of
the princes, and for each one an ox:
and they brought them before the
tabernacle.</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, Take it of them, that they
may be to do the service of the tabernacle
of the congregation; and thou
shalt give them unto the Levites, to
every man according to his service.
And Moses took the wagons and the
oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
They shall offer their offering, each
prince on his day, for the dedicating
of the altar.</p>

<p>[And all the princes of Israel offered
the same offering, each on his day.
They were twelve days offering.]</p>

<p>This was the dedication of the altar,
in the day when it was anointed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
by the princes of Israel: twelve chargers
of silver, twelve silver bowls,
twelve spoons of gold: each charger
of silver weighing an hundred and
thirty shekels, each bowl seventy:
all the silver vessels weighed two
thousand and four hundred shekels,
after the shekel of the sanctuary: the
golden spoons were twelve, full of
incense, weighing ten shekels apiece,
after the shekel of the sanctuary: all
the gold of the spoons was an hundred
and twenty shekels. All the
oxen for the burnt offering were
twelve bullocks, the rams twelve, the
lambs of the first year twelve, with
their meat offering: and the kids of
the goats for sin offering twelve.
And all the oxen for the sacrifice of
the peace offerings were twenty and
four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he
goats sixty, the lambs of the first
year sixty. This was the dedication
of the altar, after that it was anointed.
And when Moses was gone
into the tabernacle of the congregation
to speak with him, then he heard
the voice of one speaking unto him
from off the mercy seat that was
upon the ark of testimony, from between
the two cherubims: and he
spake unto him.</p>

<p>And on the day that the tabernacle
was reared up the cloud covered the
tabernacle, namely, the tent of the
testimony: and at even there was
upon the tabernacle as it were the
appearance of fire, until the morning.
So it was alway: the cloud covered
it by day, and the appearance of fire
by night. And when the cloud was
taken up from the tabernacle, then
after that the children of Israel journeyed:
and in the place where the
cloud abode, there the children of Israel
pitched their tents. At the commandment
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> the children
of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> they pitched:
as long as the cloud abode upon the
tabernacle they rested in their tents.
And when the cloud tarried long
upon the tabernacle many days, then
the children of Israel kept the charge
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and journeyed not.</p>

<p>And it came to pass on the twentieth
day of the second month, in the
second year, that the cloud was taken
up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.
And the children of Israel
took their journeys out of the wilderness
of Sinai; and the cloud rested in
the wilderness of Paran. And they
first took their journey according to
the commandment of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> by the
hand of Moses.</p>

<p>And they departed from the mount
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> three days' journey: and
the ark of the covenant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
went before them in the three days'
journey, to search out a resting place
for them. And the cloud of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
was upon them by day, when they
went out of the camp. And it came to
pass, when the ark set forward, that
Moses said, Rise up, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and let
thine enemies be scattered; and let
them that hate thee flee before thee.
And when it rested, he said, Return,
O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, unto the many thousands of
Israel.</p>

<small>THE PEOPLE MURMUR</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Numbers 11</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND when the people complained,
it displeased the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> heard it; and his anger
was kindled; and the fire of the <span class="smcap">Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></span>
burnt among them, and consumed
them that were in the uttermost parts
of the camp. And the people cried
unto Moses; and when Moses prayed
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the fire was quenched.
And the children of Israel also wept
again, and said, Who shall give us
flesh to eat? We remember the fish,
which we did eat in Egypt freely;
the cucumbers, and the melons, and
the leeks, and the onions, and the
garlick: but now our soul is dried
away: there is nothing at all, beside
this manna, before our eyes. And
the manna was as coriander seed, and
the colour thereof as the colour of
bdellium. And the people went
about, and gathered it, and ground it
in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and
baked it in pans, and made cakes of
it: and the taste of it was as the taste
of fresh oil.</div>

<p>And when the dew fell upon the
camp in the night, the manna fell
upon it.</p>

<p>Then Moses heard the people weep
throughout their families, every
man in the door of his tent: and the
anger of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was kindled greatly;
Moses also was displeased. And
Moses said unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Wherefore
hast thou afflicted thy servant? and
wherefore have I not found favour
in thy sight, that thou layest the burden
of all this people upon me?
Have I conceived all this people?
have I begotten them, that thou
shouldest say unto me, Carry them in
thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth
the sucking child, unto the land
which thou swarest unto their fathers?
Whence should I have flesh
to give unto all this people? for they
weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh,
that we may eat. I am not able to
bear all this people alone, because it
is too heavy for me. And if thou
deal thus with me, kill me, I pray
thee, out of hand, if I have found favour
in thy sight; and let me not see
my wretchedness.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Gather unto me seventy men of the
elders of Israel, whom thou knowest
to be the elders of the people, and
officers over them; and bring them
unto the tabernacle of the congregation,
that they may stand there with
thee.</p>

<p>And I will come down and talk
with thee there: and I will take of the
spirit which is upon thee, and will put
it upon them; and they shall bear the
burden of the people with thee, that
thou bear it not thyself alone. And
say thou unto the people, Sanctify
yourselves against to morrow, and ye
shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in
the ears of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, saying, Who
shall give us flesh to eat? for it was
well with us in Egypt: therefore the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> will give you flesh, and ye shall
eat. Ye shall not eat one day, nor
two days, nor five days, neither ten
days, nor twenty days; but even a
whole month, until it come out at
your nostrils, and it be loathsome
unto you: because that ye have despised
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> which is among you,
and have wept before him, saying,
Why came we forth out of Egypt?
And Moses said, The people, among
whom I am, are six hundred thousand
footmen; and thou hast said, I will
give them flesh, that they may eat a
whole month. Shall the flocks and
the herds be slain for them, to suffice
them? or shall all the fish of the sea
be gathered together for them, to suffice
them? And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Moses, Is the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> hand waxed
short? thou shalt see now whether my
word shall come to pass unto thee or
not. And Moses gat him into the
camp, he and the elders of Israel.</p>

<p>And there went forth a wind from
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and brought quails from
the sea, and let them fall by the camp,
as it were a day's journey on this
side, and as it were a day's journey
on the other side, round about the
camp, and as it were two cubits high
upon the face of the earth. And the
people stood up all that day, and all
that night, and all the next day, and
they gathered the quails: he that
gathered least gathered ten homers:
and they spread them all abroad for
themselves round about the camp.
And while the flesh was yet between
their teeth, ere it was chewed, the
wrath of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was kindled
against the people, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
smote the people with a very great
plague. And he called the name of
that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because
there they buried the people
that lusted. And the people journeyed
from Kibroth-hattaavah unto
Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.</p>

Hath the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> indeed spoken only by

suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron,
and unto Miriam, Come out ye three

And they three came out. And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came down in the pillar of
the cloud, and stood in the door of
the tabernacle, and called Aaron and
Miriam: and they both came forth.
And he said, Hear now my words:
If there be a prophet among you, I
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will make myself known
unto him in a vision, and will speak

Moses is not so, who is faithful in all

wherefore then were ye not

Moses? And the anger of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>

And the cloud departed
from off the tabernacle; and, behold,
Miriam became leprous, white as
snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam,
and, behold, she was leprous.
And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas,

sin upon us, wherein we have done
foolishly, and wherein we have
sinned. Let her not be as one dead,
of whom the flesh is half consumed.</div>

<small>THE SPIES SENT OUT</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Numbers 13</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, Send thou men, that
they may search the land of
Canaan, which I give unto the children
of Israel: of every tribe of their
fathers shall ye send a man, every
one a ruler among them.</div>

<p>And Moses sent them to spy out the
land of Canaan, and said unto them,
Get you up this way southward, and
go up into the mountain: and see the
land, what it is; and the people that
dwelleth therein, whether they be
strong or weak, few or many; and
what the land is that they dwell in,
whether it be good or bad; and what
cities they be that they dwell in,
whether in tents, or in strong holds;
and what the land is, whether it be
fat or lean, whether there be wood
therein, or not. And be ye of good
courage, and bring of the fruit of the
land. Now the time was the time of
the firstripe grapes.</p>

<p>So they went up, and searched the
land from the wilderness of Zin unto
Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
And they ascended by the south, and
came unto Hebron; and they came
unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut
down from thence a branch with one
cluster of grapes, and they bare it
between two upon a staff; and they
brought of the pomegranates, and of
the figs. And they returned from
searching of the land after forty
days.</p>

<p>And they went and came to Moses,
and to Aaron, and to all the congregation
of the children of Israel, unto
the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh;
and brought back word unto them,
and unto all the congregation, and
shewed them the fruit of the land.
And they told him, and said, We
came unto the land whither thou sentest
us, and surely it floweth with milk
and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
Nevertheless the people be strong
that dwell in the land, and the cities
are walled, and very great: and
moreover we saw the children of
Anak there. The Amalekites dwell in
the land of the south: and the Hittites,
and the Jebusites, and the Amorites,
dwell in the mountains: and the
Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by
the coast of Jordan.</p>

<p>And Caleb [who was one of the
twelve spies that went up] stilled the
people before Moses, and said, Let
us go up at once, and possess it; for
we are well able to overcome it. But
the men that went up with him said,
We be not able to go up against the
people; for they are stronger than
we. And they brought up an evil report
of the land which they had
searched unto the children of Israel,
saying, The land, through which we
have gone to search it, is a land that
eateth up the inhabitants thereof;
and all the people that we saw in it
are men of a great stature. And

Anak, which come of the giants: and
we were in our own sight as grasshoppers,
and so we were in their
sight.</p>

<small>THE ISRAELITES REBEL, AND ARE
TURNED BACK TO WANDER
IN THE WILDERNESS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Numbers 14</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND all the congregation lifted
up their voice, and cried; and
the people wept that night.
And all the children of Israel murmured
against Moses and against
Aaron: and the whole congregation
said unto them, Would God that we
had died in the land of Egypt! or
would God we had died in this wilderness!
And wherefore hath the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
brought us unto this land, to fall by
the sword, that our wives and our
children should be a prey? were it
not better for us to return into
Egypt? And they said one to another,
Let us make a captain, and let
us return into Egypt. Then Moses
and Aaron fell on their faces before
all the assembly of the congregation
of the children of Israel.</div>

<p>And Joshua the son of Nun, and
Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
were of them that searched the land,
rent their clothes: and they spake
unto all the company of the children
of Israel, saying, The land, which we
passed through to search it, is an exceeding
good land. If the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> delight
in us, then he will bring us
into this land, and give it us; a land
which floweth with milk and honey.
Only rebel not ye against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
neither fear ye the people of the
land; for they are bread for us: their
defence is departed from them, and
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is with us: fear them not.
But all the congregation bade stone
them with stones. And the glory of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared in the tabernacle
of the congregation before all the
children of Israel.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
How long will this people provoke
me? and how long will it be ere they
believe me, for all the signs which I
have shewed among them? I will
smite them with the pestilence, and
disinherit them, and will make of
thee a greater nation and mightier
than they.</p>

<p>And Moses said unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
Then the Egyptians shall hear it,
(for thou broughtest up this people
in thy might from among them;) and
they will tell it to the inhabitants of
this land: for they have heard that
thou <span class="smcap">Lord</span> art among this people, that
thou <span class="smcap">Lord</span> art seen face to face, and
that thy cloud standeth over them,
and that thou goest before them, by
day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in
a pillar of fire by night.</p>

<p>Now if thou shalt kill all this people
as one man, then the nations
which have heard the fame of thee
will speak, saying, Because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
was not able to bring this people into
the land which he sware unto them,
therefore he hath slain them in the
wilderness. And now, I beseech thee,
let the power of my Lord be great,
according as thou hast spoken, saying,
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is longsuffering, and
of great mercy, forgiving iniquity
and transgression, and by no means
clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity
of the fathers upon the children
unto the third and fourth generation.
Pardon, I beseech thee, the
iniquity of this people according unto
the greatness of thy mercy, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
thou hast forgiven this people, from
Egypt even until now.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said, I have pardoned
according to thy word: but
as truly as I live, all the earth shall
be filled with the glory of the LORD.
Because all those men which have
seen my glory, and my miracles,
which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness,
and have tempted me now
these ten times, and have not hearkened
to my voice; surely they shall
not see the land which I sware unto
their fathers, neither shall any of
them that provoked me see it: but my
servant Caleb, because he had another
spirit with him, and hath followed me
fully, him will I bring into the land
whereinto he went; and his seed shall
possess it. To morrow turn you, and
get you into the wilderness by the
way of the Red sea.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses
and unto Aaron, saying, How long
shall I bear with this evil congregation,
which murmur against me? I
have heard the murmurings of the
children of Israel, which they murmur
against me. Say unto them, As
truly as I live, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, as ye
have spoken in mine ears, so will I do
to you: your carcases shall fall in
this wilderness; and all that were
numbered of you, according to your
whole number, from twenty years old
and upward, which have murmured
against me, doubtless ye shall not
come into the land, concerning which
I sware to make you dwell therein,
save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and
Joshua the son of Nun. But your little
ones, which ye said should be a
prey, them will I bring in, and they
shall know the land which ye have
despised. But as for you, your carcases,
they shall fall in this wilderness.
After the number of the days
in which ye searched the land, even
forty days, each day for a year, shall
ye bear your iniquities, even forty
years, and ye shall know my breach
of promise. I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> have said, I
will surely do it unto all this evil congregation,
that are gathered together
against me: in this wilderness they
shall be consumed, and there they
shall die.</p>

<p>And the men, which Moses sent to
search the land, who returned, and
made all the congregation to murmur
against him, by bringing up a slander
upon the land, even those men that
did bring up the evil report upon the
land, died by the plague before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. But Joshua the son of Nun,
and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
which were of the men that went to
search the land, lived still. And
Moses told these sayings unto all the
children of Israel: and the people
mourned greatly.</p>

<p>And they rose up early in the
morning, and gat them up into the
top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we
be here, and will go up unto the place
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath promised: for
we have sinned. And Moses said,
Wherefore now do ye transgress the
commandment of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? but it
shall not prosper. Go not up, for the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> is not among you; that ye be not
smitten before your enemies. For
the Amalekites and the Canaanites
are there before you, and ye shall
fall by the sword: because ye are
turned away from the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, therefore
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will not be with you.
But they presumed to go up unto the
hill top: nevertheless the ark of the
covenant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and Moses, departed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
not out of the camp. Then the
Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites
which dwelt in that hill, and
smote them, and discomfited them,
even unto Hormah.</p>

<small>THE REBELLION OF KORAH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Numbers 16</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW Korah, the son of Izhar,
the son of Kohath, the son of
Levi, and Dathan and Abiram,
the sons of Eliab, and On, the
son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took
men: and they rose up before Moses,
with certain of the children of Israel,
two hundred and fifty princes of the
assembly, famous in the congregation,
men of renown: and they gathered
themselves together against
Moses and against Aaron, and said
unto them, Ye take too much upon
you, seeing all the congregation are
holy, every one of them, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
is among them: wherefore then lift
ye up yourselves above the congregation
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>?</div>

<p>And when Moses heard it, he fell
upon his face: and he spake unto
Korah and unto all his company, saying,
Even to morrow the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will
shew who are his, and who is holy;
and will cause him to come near unto
him: even him whom he hath chosen
will he cause to come near unto him.
This do; Take you censers, Korah,
and all his company; and put fire
therein, and put incense in them before
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to morrow: and it shall
be that the man whom the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> doth
choose, he shall be holy: ye take too
much upon you, ye sons of Levi.</p>

<p>And Moses said unto Korah, Hear,
I pray you, ye sons of Levi: seemeth
it but a small thing unto you, that the
God of Israel hath separated you
from the congregation of Israel, to
bring you near to himself to do the
service of the tabernacle of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and to stand before the congregation
to minister unto them? And he hath
brought thee near to him, and all thy
brethren the sons of Levi with thee:
and seek ye the priesthood also?
For which cause both thou and all
thy company are gathered together
against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and what is Aaron,
that ye murmur against him?</p>

<p>And Moses sent to call Dathan and
Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which
said, We will not come up: is it a
small thing that thou hast brought us
up out of a land that floweth with
milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,
except thou make thyself altogether
a prince over us? Moreover
thou hast not brought us into a land
that floweth with milk and honey, or
given us inheritance of fields and
vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes
of these men? we will not come up.</p>

<p>And Moses was very wroth, and
said unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Respect not thou
their offering: I have not taken one
ass from them, neither have I hurt
one of them. And Moses said unto
Korah, Be thou and all thy company
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, thou, and they, and
Aaron, to morrow: and take every
man his censer, and put incense in
them, and bring ye before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
every man his censer, two hundred
and fifty censers; thou also, and
Aaron, each of you his censer.</p>

<p>And they took every man his censer,
and put fire in them, and laid incense
thereon, and stood in the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of the tabernacle of the congregation
with Moses and Aaron. And Korah
gathered all the congregation against
them unto the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation: and the glory
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared unto all the
congregation. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake
unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Separate yourselves from among this
congregation, that I may consume
them in a moment.</p>

<p>And they fell upon their faces, and
said, O God, the God of the spirits of
all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt
thou be wroth with all the congregation?</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, Speak unto the congregation,
saying, Get you up from about the
tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and
Abiram.</p>

<p>And Moses rose up and went unto
Dathan and Abiram; and the elders
of Israel followed him. And he
spake unto the congregation, saying,
Depart, I pray you, from the tents
of these wicked men, and touch nothing
of their's, lest ye be consumed
in all their sins. So they gat up from
the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and
Abiram, on every side: and Dathan
and Abiram came out, and stood in
the door of their tents, and their
wives, and their sons, and their little
children. And Moses said, Hereby
ye shall know that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath sent
me to do all these works; for I have
not done them of mine own mind. If
these men die the common death of
all men, or if they be visited after the
visitation of all men; then the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
hath not sent me. But if the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
make a new thing, and the earth open
her mouth, and swallow them up,
with all that appertain unto them, and
they go down quick into the pit; then
ye shall understand that these men
have provoked the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, as he had
made an end of speaking all these
words, that the ground clave asunder
that was under them: and the earth
opened her mouth, and swallowed
them up, and their houses, and all the
men that appertained unto Korah,
and all their goods. They, and all
that appertained to them, went down
alive into the pit, and the earth closed
upon them: and they perished from
among the congregation. And all Israel
that were round about them fled
at the cry of them: for they said,
Lest the earth swallow us up also.</p>

<p>But on the morrow all the congregation
of the children of Israel murmured
against Moses and against
Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the
people of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And it came to
pass, when the congregation was
gathered against Moses and against
Aaron, that they looked toward the
tabernacle of the congregation: and,
behold, the cloud covered it, and the
glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared. And
Moses and Aaron came before the
tabernacle of the congregation. And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses, saying,
Get you up from among this congregation,
that I may consume them as
in a moment. And they fell upon
their faces.</p>

<p>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take
a censer, and put fire therein from
off the altar, and put on incense, and
go quickly unto the congregation,
and make an atonement for them: for
there is wrath gone out from the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>; the plague is begun. And
Aaron took as Moses commanded,
and ran into the midst of the congregation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and, behold, the plague was
begun among the people: and he put
on incense, and made an atonement
for the people. And he stood between
the dead and the living; and
the plague was stayed.</p>

<p>Now they that died in the plague
were fourteen thousand and seven
hundred, beside them that died about
the matter of Korah. And Aaron
returned unto Moses unto the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation:
and the plague was stayed.</p>

<small>AARON'S ROD</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Numbers 17</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, Speak unto the children
of Israel, and take of
every one of them a rod according to
the house of their fathers, of all their
princes according to the house of
their fathers twelve rods: write thou
every man's name upon his rod.
And thou shalt write Aaron's name
upon the rod of Levi: for one rod
shall be for the head of the house of
their fathers. And thou shalt lay
them up in the tabernacle of the congregation
before the testimony, where
I will meet with you. And it shall
come to pass, that the man's rod,
whom I shall choose, shall blossom:
and I will make to cease from me the
murmurings of the children of Israel,
whereby they murmur against you.</div>

<p>And Moses spake unto the children
of Israel, and every one of their
princes gave him a rod apiece, for
each prince one, according to their
fathers' houses, even twelve rods:
and the rod of Aaron was among
their rods. And Moses laid up the
rods before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in the tabernacle
of witness.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, that on the
morrow Moses went into the tabernacle
of witness; and, behold, the rod
of Aaron for the house of Levi was
budded, and brought forth buds, and
bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.
And Moses brought out all
the rods from before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> unto
all the children of Israel: and they
looked, and took every man his rod.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
Bring Aaron's rod again before the
testimony, to be kept for a token
against the rebels; and thou shalt
quite take away their murmurings
from me, that they die not. And
Moses did so: as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded
him, so did he. And the children
of Israel spake unto Moses, saying,
Behold, we die, we perish, we all
perish. Whosoever cometh any thing
near unto the tabernacle of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shall die: shall we be consumed with
dying?</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Aaron,
Thou shalt have no inheritance in
their land, neither shalt thou have
any part among them: I am thy part
and thine inheritance among the children
of Israel. And, behold, I have
given the children of Levi all the
tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for
their service which they serve, even
the service of the tabernacle of the
congregation.</p>

<p>Neither must the children of Israel
henceforth come nigh the tabernacle
of the congregation, lest they bear
sin, and die. But the Levites shall
do the service of the tabernacle of the
congregation, and they shall bear
their iniquity: it shall be a statute for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
ever throughout your generations,
that among the children of Israel
they have no inheritance. But the
tithes of the children of Israel, which
they offer as an heave offering unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I have given to the Levites
to inherit: therefore I have said unto
them, Among the children of Israel
they shall have no inheritance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Numbers 20</div>

<p>Then came the children of Israel,
even the whole congregation, into the
desert of Zin in the first month: and
the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam
died there, and was buried
there.</p>

<p>And there was no water for the
congregation: and they gathered
themselves together against Moses
and against Aaron. And the people
chode with Moses, and spake, saying,
Would God that we had died
when our brethren died before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>! And why have ye brought up
the congregation of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> into
this wilderness, that we and our cattle
should die there? And wherefore
have ye made us to come up out of
Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil
place? it is no place of seed, or of
figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates;
neither is there any water to drink.
And Moses and Aaron went from the
presence of the assembly unto the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
and they fell upon their faces:
and the glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared
unto them.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, Take the rod, and gather thou
the assembly together, thou, and
Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto
the rock before their eyes; and it shall
give forth his water, and thou shalt
bring forth to them water out of the
rock: so thou shalt give the congregation
and their beasts drink. And
Moses took the rod from before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, as he commanded him.</p>

<p>And Moses and Aaron gathered the
congregation together before the rock,
and he said unto them, Hear now, ye
rebels; must we fetch you water out
of this rock? And Moses lifted up
his hand, and with his rod he smote
the rock twice: and the water came
out abundantly, and the congregation
drank, and their beasts also.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses
and Aaron, Because ye believed me
not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the
children of Israel, therefore ye shall
not bring this congregation into the
land which I have given them. This
is the water of Meribah; because the
children of Israel strove with the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and he was sanctified in them.</p>

<p>And the children of Israel, even
the whole congregation, journeyed
from Kadesh, and came unto mount
Hor.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses
and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast
of the land of Edom, saying, Aaron
shall be gathered unto his people: for
he shall not enter into the land which
I have given unto the children of Israel,
because ye rebelled against my
word at the water of Meribah. Take
Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring
them up unto mount Hor: and strip
Aaron of his garments, and put them
upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron
shall be gathered unto his people, and
shall die there.</p>

<p>And Moses did as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded:
and they went up into mount
Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
And Moses stripped Aaron of
his garments, and put them upon
Eleazar his son; and Aaron died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
there in the top of the mount: and
Moses and Eleazar came down from
the mount. And when all the congregation
saw that Aaron was dead, they
mourned for Aaron thirty days, even
all the house of Israel.</p>

<small>THE BRAZEN SERPENT</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Numbers 21</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND they journeyed from mount
Hor by the way of the Red
sea, to compass the land of
Edom: and the soul of the people
was much discouraged because of
the way. And the people spake
against God, and against Moses,
Wherefore have ye brought us up
out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?
for there is no bread, neither
is there any water; and our soul
loatheth this light bread. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> sent fiery serpents among the
people, and they bit the people; and
much people of Israel died.</div>

<p>Therefore the people came to
Moses, and said, We have sinned, for
we have spoken against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
against thee; pray unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that
he take away the serpents from us.
And Moses prayed for the people.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Make
thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon
a pole: and it shall come to pass, that
every one that is bitten, when he looketh
upon it, shall live. And Moses
made a serpent of brass, and put it
upon a pole, and it came to pass, that
if a serpent had bitten any man, when
he beheld the serpent of brass, he
lived.</p>

<p>And Israel sent messengers unto
Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
Let me pass through thy land: we
will not turn into the fields, or into
the vineyards; we will not drink of
the waters of the well: but we will go
along by the king's high way, until
we be past thy borders. And Sihon
would not suffer Israel to pass
through his border: but Sihon gathered
all his people together, and went
out against Israel into the wilderness:
and he came to Jahaz, and
fought against Israel. And Israel
smote him with the edge of the sword,
and possessed his land from Arnon
unto Jabbok, even unto the children
of Ammon: for the border of the children
of Ammon was strong. And
Israel took all these cities: and Israel
dwelt in all the cities of the
Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the
villages thereof. Thus Israel dwelt
in the land of the Amorites. And they
turned and went up by the way of Bashan:
and Og the king of Bashan went
out against them, he, and all his people,
to the battle at Edrei. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Fear him not:
for I have delivered him into thy
hand, and all his people, and his land,
and thou shalt do to him as thou didst
unto Sihon king of the Amorites,

smote him, and his sons, and all his

forward, and pitched in the
plains of Moab on this side
Jordan by Jericho.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>And Balak the son of Zippor saw
all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
And Moab was sore afraid of
the people, because they were many:
and Moab was distressed because of
the children of Israel. And Moab
said unto the elders of Midian, Now
shall this company lick up all that are
round about us, as the ox licketh up
the grass of the field. And Balak the
son of Zippor was king of the Moabites
at that time.</p>

<p>He sent messengers therefore unto
Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor,
which is by the river of the land of
the children of his people, to call him,
saying, Behold, there is a people
come out from Egypt: behold, they
cover the face of the earth, and they
abide over against me: come now
therefore, I pray thee, curse me this
people; for they are too mighty for
me: peradventure I shall prevail,
that we may smite them, and that I
may drive them out of the land: for
I wot that he whom thou blessest is
blessed, and he whom thou cursest is
cursed.</p>

<p>And the elders of Moab and the
elders of Midian departed with the
rewards of divination in their hand;
and they came unto Balaam, and
spake unto him the words of Balak.
And he said unto them, Lodge here
this night, and I will bring you word
again, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall speak unto
me: and the princes of Moab abode
with Balaam.</p>

<p>And God came unto Balaam, and
said, What men are these with thee?
And Balaam said unto God, Balak
the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath
sent unto me, saying, Behold, there
is a people come out of Egypt, which
covereth the face of the earth: come
now, curse me them; peradventure I
shall be able to overcome them, and
drive them out. And God said unto
Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them;
thou shalt not curse the people: for
they are blessed.</p>

<p>And Balaam rose up in the morning,
and said unto the princes of
Balak, Get you into your land: for
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> refuseth to give me leave
to go with you. And the princes of
Moab rose up, and they went unto
Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to
come with us.</p>

<p>And Balak sent yet again princes,
more, and more honourable than they.
And they came to Balaam, and said to
him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor,
Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder
thee from coming unto me: for I will
promote thee unto very great honour,
and I will do whatsoever thou sayest
unto me: come therefore, I pray thee,
curse me this people. And Balaam
answered and said unto the servants
of Balak, If Balak would give me his
house full of silver and gold, I cannot
go beyond the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my
God, to do less or more. Now therefore,
I pray you, tarry ye also here
this night, that I may know what the

<p>And God came unto Balaam at
night, and said unto him, If the men
come to call thee, rise up, and go with
them; but yet the word which I shall
say unto thee, that shalt thou do.
And Balaam rose up in the morning,
and saddled his ass, and went with
the princes of Moab.</p>

<p>And God's anger was kindled because
he went: and the angel of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> stood in the way for an adversary
against him. Now he was riding
upon his ass, and his two servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
were with him. And the ass saw the
angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> standing in the
way, and his sword drawn in his
hand: and the ass turned aside out of
the way, and went into the field: and
Balaam smote the ass, to turn her
into the way. But the angel of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> stood in a path of the vineyards,
a wall being on this side, and a wall
on that side. And when the ass saw
the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, she thrust herself
unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's
foot against the wall: and he
smote her again. And the angel of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> went further, and stood in
a narrow place, where was no way
to turn either to the right hand or
to the left. And when the ass saw the
angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, she fell down
under Balaam: and Balaam's anger
was kindled, and he smote the ass
with a staff. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> opened
the mouth of the ass, and she said
unto Balaam, What have I done unto
thee, that thou hast smitten me these
three times? And Balaam said unto
the ass, Because thou hast mocked
me: I would there were a sword in
mine hand, for now would I kill thee.
And the ass said unto Balaam, Am
not I thine ass, upon which thou hast
ridden ever since I was thine unto
this day? was I ever wont to do so
unto thee? And he said, Nay.</p>

<p>Then the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> opened the eyes of
Balaam, and he saw the angel of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> standing in the way, and his
sword drawn in his hand: and he
bowed down his head, and fell flat on
his face. And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
smitten thine ass these three times?
behold, I went out to withstand thee,
because thy way is perverse before
me: and the ass saw me, and turned
from me these three times: unless she
had turned from me, surely now also
I had slain thee, and saved her alive.
And Balaam said unto the angel of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I have sinned; for I knew
not that thou stoodest in the way
against me: now therefore, if it displease
thee, I will get me back again.
And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto
Balaam, Go with the men: but only
the word that I shall speak unto thee,
that thou shalt speak. So Balaam
went with the princes of Balak.</p>

<p>And when Balak heard that Balaam
was come, he went out to meet
him unto a city of Moab, which is in
the border of Arnon, which is in the
utmost coast. And Balak said unto
Balaam, Did I not earnestly send
unto thee to call thee? wherefore
camest thou not unto me? am I not
able indeed to promote thee to honour?
And Balaam said unto Balak,
Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now
any power at all to say any thing?
the word that God putteth in my
mouth, that shall I speak. And Balaam
went with Balak, and they came
unto Kirjath-huzoth. And Balak offered
oxen and sheep, and sent to
Balaam, and to the princes that were
with him. And it came to pass on the
morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
brought him up into the high places
of Baal, that thence he might see the
utmost part of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Numbers 23</div>

<p>And Balaam said unto Balak,
Build me here seven altars, and prepare
me here seven oxen and seven
rams. And Balak did as Balaam had
spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered
on every altar a bullock and a
ram. And Balaam said unto Balak,
Stand by thy burnt offering, and I
will go: peradventure the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
come to meet me: and whatsoever he
sheweth me I will tell thee. And he
went to an high place.</p>

<p>And God met Balaam: and he said
unto him, I have prepared seven
altars, and I have offered upon every
altar a bullock and a ram. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> put a word in Balaam's mouth,
and said, Return unto Balak, and
thus thou shalt speak. And he returned
unto him, and, lo, he stood by
his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the
princes of Moab.</p>

<p>And he took up his parable, and
said, Balak the king of Moab hath
brought me from Aram, out of the
mountains of the east, saying, Come,
curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.
How shall I curse, whom God
hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,
whom the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath not defied? For
from the top of the rocks I see him,
and from the hills I behold him: lo,
the people shall dwell alone, and shall
not be reckoned among the nations.
Who can count the dust of Jacob,
and the number of the fourth part of
Israel? Let me die the death of the
righteous, and let my last end be like
his!</p>

<p>And Balak said unto Balaam,
What hast thou done unto me? I took
thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold,
thou hast blessed them altogether.
And he answered and said,
Must I not take heed to speak that
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath put in my
mouth? And Balak said unto him,
Come, I pray thee, with me unto another
place, from whence thou mayest
see them: thou shalt see but the
utmost part of them, and shalt not see
them all: and curse me them from
thence. And he brought him into the
field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah,
and built seven altars, and offered a
bullock and a ram on every altar.
And he said unto Balak, Stand here
by thy burnt offering, while I meet
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> yonder. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> met
Balaam, and put a word in his mouth,
and said, Go again unto Balak, and
say thus. And when he came to him,
behold, he stood by his burnt offering,
and the princes of Moab with him.
And Balak said unto him, What hath
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spoken?</p>

<p>And he took up his parable, and
said, Rise up, Balak, and hear;
hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
God is not a man, that he should lie;
neither the son of man, that he should
repent: hath he said, and shall he not
do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he
not make it good? Behold, I have received
commandment to bless: and he
hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob,
neither hath he seen perverseness in
Israel: the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God is with him,
and the shout of a king is among
them. God brought them out of
Egypt; he hath as it were the
strength of an unicorn. Surely there
is no enchantment against Jacob,
neither is there any divination against
Israel: according to this time it shall
be said of Jacob and of Israel, What
hath God wrought! Behold, the people
shall rise up as a great lion, and
lift up himself as a young lion: he
shall not lie down until he eat of the
prey, and drink the blood of the
slain.</p>

<p>And Balak said unto Balaam,
Neither curse them at all, nor bless
them at all. But Balaam answered
and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
saying, All that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> speaketh,
that I must do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Numbers 24</div>

<p>And Balak said unto Balaam,
Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee
unto another place; peradventure it
will please God that thou mayest
curse me them from thence. And
Balak brought Balaam unto the top
of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.
And Balaam said unto Balak,
Build me here seven altars, and prepare
me here seven bullocks and
seven rams. And Balak did as Balaam
had said, and offered a bullock and a
ram on every altar. And Balaam
lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel
abiding in his tents according to their
tribes; and the spirit of God came
upon him. And he took up his parable,
and said, Balaam the son of
Beor hath said, and the man whose
eyes are open hath said: he hath said,
which heard the words of God, which
saw the vision of the Almighty, falling
into a trance, but having his eyes
open: How goodly are thy tents, O
Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!
As the valleys are they spread forth,
as gardens by the river's side, as the
trees of lign aloes which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
hath planted, and as cedar trees beside
the waters. He shall pour the
water out of his buckets, and his seed
shall be in many waters, and his king
shall be higher than Agag, and his
kingdom shall be exalted. God
brought him forth out of Egypt; he
hath as it were the strength of an
unicorn: he shall eat up the nations
his enemies, and shall break their
bones, and pierce them through with
his arrows. He couched, he lay
down as a lion, and as a great lion:
who shall stir him up? Blessed is he
that blesseth thee, and cursed is he
that curseth thee.</p>

<p>And Balak's anger was kindled
against Balaam, and he smote his
hands together: and Balak said unto
Balaam, I called thee to curse mine
enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether
blessed them these three
times. Therefore now flee thou to thy
place: I thought to promote thee unto
great honour; but, lo, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath
kept thee back from honour. And
Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not
also to thy messengers which thou
sentest unto me, saying, If Balak
would give me his house full of silver
and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to do either
good or bad of mine own mind; but
what the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> saith, that will I speak?
And now, behold, I go unto my
people: come therefore, and I will
advertise thee what this people
shall do to thy people in the latter
days.</p>

<p>And he took up his parable, and
said, Balaam the son of Beor hath
said, and the man whose eyes are
open hath said: he hath said, which
heard the words of God, and knew the
knowledge of the most High, which
saw the vision of the Almighty, falling
into a trance, but having his eyes
open: I shall see him, but not now:
I shall behold him, but not nigh:
there shall come a Star out of Jacob,
and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel,
and shall smite the corners of Moab,
and destroy all the children of Sheth.
And Edom shall be a possession, Seir
also shall be a possession for his enemies;
and Israel shall do valiantly.
Out of Jacob shall come he that shall
have dominion, and shall destroy him
that remaineth of the city. And Balaam
rose up, and went and returned
to his place: and Balak also went his
way.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_59" id="CHAPTER_59">CHAPTER 59</a><br />

<small>THE ISRAELITES NUMBERED
THE SECOND TIME</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Numbers 26</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, that the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses and
unto Eleazar the son of Aaron
the priest, saying, Take the sum of
all the congregation of the children
of Israel, from twenty years old and
upward, throughout their fathers'
house, all that are able to go to war
in Israel. And these were the numbered
of the children of Israel, six
hundred thousand and a thousand
seven hundred and thirty. These are
they that were numbered by Moses
and Eleazar the priest, who numbered
the children of Israel in the
plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
But among these there was not
a man of them whom Moses and
Aaron the priest numbered, when
they numbered the children of Israel
in the wilderness of Sinai. For the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> had said of them, They shall
surely die in the wilderness. And
there was not left a man of them, save
Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and
Joshua the son of Nun.</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Get
thee up into this mount Abarim, and
see the land which I have given unto
the children of Israel. And when
thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be
gathered unto thy people, as Aaron
thy brother was gathered. For ye
rebelled against my commandment in
the desert of Zin, in the strife of
the congregation, to sanctify me at
the water before their eyes: that is
the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the
wilderness of Zin.</p>

<p>And Moses spake unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
saying, Let the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the God of the
spirits of all flesh, set a man over
the congregation, which may go out
before them, and which may go in before
them, and which may lead them
out, and which may bring them in;
that the congregation of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> be
not as sheep which have no shepherd.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Take
thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in
whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand
upon him; and set him before Eleazar
the priest, and before all the congregation;
and give him a charge in
their sight. And thou shalt put some
of thine honour upon him, that all the
congregation of the children of Israel
may be obedient.</p>

<p>And Moses did as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded
him: and he took Joshua,
and set him before Eleazar the priest,
and before all the congregation: and
he laid his hands upon him, and gave
him a charge, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded
by the hand of Moses.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses,
saying, Avenge the children of Israel
of the Midianites: afterward shalt
thou be gathered unto thy people.
And Moses spake unto the people,
saying, Arm some of yourselves unto
the war, and let them go against the
Midianites, and avenge the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of
Midian. And they warred against
the Midianites, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded
Moses; and they slew all the
males. And they slew the kings of
Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor
they slew with the sword.</p>

<p>Now the children of Reuben and
the children of Gad had a very great
multitude of cattle: and when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
saw the land of Jazer, and the land
of Gilead, that, behold, the place was
a place for cattle; the children of Gad
and the children of Reuben came and
spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar
the priest, and unto the princes of
the congregation, saying, If we have
found grace in thy sight, let this
land be given unto thy servants for
a possession, and bring us not over
Jordan.</p>

<p>And they came near unto him, and
said, We will build sheepfolds here
for our cattle, and cities for our little
ones: but we ourselves will go ready
armed before the children of Israel,
until we have brought them unto their
place: and our little ones shall dwell
in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants
of the land. We will not
return unto our houses, until the children
of Israel have inherited every
man his inheritance.</p>

<p>And Moses said unto them, If ye
will do this thing, if ye will go armed
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to war, build you
cities for your little ones, and folds
for your sheep; and do that which
hath proceeded out of your mouth.
And the children of Gad and the children
of Reuben spake unto Moses,
saying, Thy servants will do as my
lord commandeth. Our little ones,
our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,
shall be there in the cities of
Gilead: but thy servants will pass
over, every man armed for war, before
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to battle, as my lord
saith. And Moses gave unto them,
even to the children of Gad, and to
the children of Reuben, and unto half
the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph,
the kingdom of Sihon king of
the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og
king of Bashan, the land, with the
cities thereof in the coasts, even the
cities of the country round about.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Numbers 33</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses in
the plains of Moab by Jordan near
Jericho, saying, Speak unto the children
of Israel, and say unto them,
When ye are passed over Jordan into
the land of Canaan; then ye shall
drive out all the inhabitants of the
land from before you, and destroy
all their pictures, and destroy all
their molten images, and quite pluck
down all their high places: and ye
shall dispossess the inhabitants of the
land, and dwell therein: for I have
given you the land to possess it. And
ye shall divide the land by lot for an
inheritance among your families: and
to the more ye shall give the more inheritance,
and to the fewer ye shall
give the less inheritance: every
man's inheritance shall be in the place
where his lot falleth; according to the
tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants
of the land from before
you; then it shall come to pass, that
those which ye let remain of them
shall be pricks in your eyes, and
thorns in your sides, and shall vex
you in the land wherein ye dwell.
Moreover it shall come to pass, that
I shall do unto you, as I thought to
do unto them.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses in
the plains of Moab by Jordan near
Jericho, saying, Command the children
of Israel, that they give unto
the Levites of the inheritance of their
possession cities to dwell in; and ye
shall give also unto the Levites suburbs
for the cities round about them.
And among the cities which ye shall
give unto the Levites there shall be
six cities for refuge, which ye shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
appoint for the manslayer, that he
may flee thither: and to them ye shall
add forty and two cities. So all the
cities which ye shall give to the Levites
shall be forty and eight cities:
them shall ye give with their suburbs.</p>

<p>Ye shall give three cities on this
side Jordan, and three cities shall ye
give in the land of Canaan, which
shall be cities of refuge, both for the
children of Israel, and for the stranger,
and for the sojourner among
them: that every one that killeth any
person unawares may flee thither.
And they shall be unto you cities for
refuge from the avenger; that the
manslayer die not, until he stand before
the congregation in judgment.</p>

<small>THE DEATH OF MOSES</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Deuteronomy 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass in the fortieth
year, in the eleventh
month, on the first day of the
month, that Moses spake unto the
children of Israel, according unto
all that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had given him in
commandment unto them. And
Moses, after rehearsing to them the
story of God's promises and of his
anger at their unbelief and disobedience;
and how after their wanderings
they had conquered Sihon the Amorite,
and Og the king of Bashan, and
taken possession of their lands, said,</div>

<p>I commanded Joshua at that time,
saying, Thine eyes have seen all that
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God hath done unto
these two kings: so shall the LORD do
unto all the kingdoms whither thou
passest. Ye shall not fear them: for
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God he shall fight for
you. And I besought the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> at that
time, saying, O Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>, thou hast
begun to shew thy servant thy greatness,
and thy mighty hand: for what
God is there in heaven or in earth,
that can do according to thy works,
and according to thy might? I pray
thee, let me go over, and see the good
land that is beyond Jordan, that
goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</p>

<p>But the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was wroth with me
for your sakes, and would not hear
me: and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto me, Let it
suffice thee; speak no more unto me of
this matter. Get thee up into the top
of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes
westward, and northward, and southward,
and eastward, and behold it
with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go
over this Jordan. But charge Joshua,
and encourage him, and strengthen
him: for he shall go over before this
people, and he shall cause them to inherit
the land which thou shalt see.</p>

<p>Behold, I have taught you statutes
and judgments, even as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my
God commanded me, that ye should
do so in the land whither ye go to
possess it. Keep therefore and do
them; for this is your wisdom and
your understanding in the sight of
the nations, which shall hear all these
statutes, and say, Surely this great
nation is a wise and understanding
people. For what nation is there so
great, who hath God so nigh unto
them, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God is in all
things that we call upon him for?
And what nation is there so great,
that hath statutes and judgments so
righteous as all this law, which I set
before you this day? Only take heed
to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently,
lest thou forget the things which
thine eyes have seen, and lest they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
depart from thy heart all the days of
thy life: but teach them thy sons, and
thy sons' sons; specially the day that
thou stoodest before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God
in Horeb, when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto
me, Gather me the people together,
and I will make them hear my words,
that they may learn to fear me all the
days that they shall live upon the
earth, and that they may teach their
children. And ye came near and
stood under the mountain; and the
mountain burned with fire unto the
midst of heaven, with darkness,
clouds, and thick darkness. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto you out of the midst
of the fire: ye heard the voice of the
words, but saw no similitude; only ye
heard a voice. And he declared unto
you his covenant, which he commanded
you to perform, even ten commandments;
and he wrote them upon two
tables of stone. Take heed unto
yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God, which he
made with you, and make you a graven
image, or the likeness of any
thing, which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God hath
forbidden thee. For the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy
God is a consuming fire, even a jealous
God.</p>

<p>When thou shalt beget children,
and children's children, and ye shall
have remained long in the land, and
shall corrupt yourselves, and make a
graven image, or the likeness of any
thing, and shall do evil in the sight of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, to provoke him to
anger: I call heaven and earth to
witness against you this day, that ye
shall soon utterly perish from off the
land whereunto ye go over Jordan to
possess it; ye shall not prolong
your days upon it, but shall utterly be
destroyed. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall scatter
you among the nations, and ye
shall be left few in number among the
heathen, whither the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall lead
you. And there ye shall serve gods,
the work of men's hands, wood and
stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor
eat, nor smell. But if from thence
thou shalt seek the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God,
thou shalt find him, if thou seek him
with all thy heart and with all thy
soul. When thou art in tribulation,
and all these things are come upon
thee, even in the latter days, if thou
turn to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, and shalt be
obedient unto his voice: (for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
thy God is a merciful God;) he will
not forsake thee, neither destroy
thee, nor forget the covenant of thy
fathers which he sware unto them.</p>

<p>Know therefore this day, and consider
it in thine heart, that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
he is God in heaven above, and upon
the earth beneath: there is none else.
Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes,
and his commandments, which I command
thee this day, that it may go
well with thee, and with thy children
after thee, and that thou mayest prolong
thy days upon the earth, which
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God giveth thee, for
ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deuteronomy 6</div>

<p>And Moses rehearsed to the people
the ten commandments, and said,</p>

<p>Hear, O Israel: The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God
is one <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and thou shalt love the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God with all thine heart,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy
might. And these words, which I
command thee this day, shall be in
thine heart: and thou shalt teach
them diligently unto thy children, and
shalt talk of them when thou sittest
in thine house, and when thou walkest
by the way, and when thou liest down,
and when thou risest up. And thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
shalt bind them for a sign upon thine
hand, and they shall be as frontlets
between thine eyes. And thou shalt
write them upon the posts of thy
house, and on thy gates.</p>

<p>And thou shalt remember all the
way which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God led thee
these forty years in the wilderness,
to humble thee, and to prove thee, to
know what was in thine heart, whether
thou wouldest keep his commandments,
or no. And he humbled thee,
and suffered thee to hunger, and fed
thee with manna, which thou knewest
not, neither did thy fathers know;
that he might make thee know that
man doth not live by bread only, but
by every word that proceedeth out of
the mouth of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> doth man live.
Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee,
neither did thy foot swell, these forty
years. Thou shalt also consider in
thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth
his son, so the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God chasteneth
thee. Therefore thou shalt keep
the commandments of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy
God, to walk in his ways, and to fear
him.</p>

<p>For the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God bringeth thee
into a good land, a land of brooks of
water, of fountains and depths that
spring out of valleys and hills; a land
of wheat, and barley, and vines, and
fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of
oil olive, and honey; a land wherein
thou shalt eat bread without scarceness,
thou shalt not lack any thing in
it; a land whose stones are iron, and
out of whose hills thou mayest dig
brass. When thou hast eaten and art
full, then thou shalt bless the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
thy God for the good land which he
hath given thee. Beware that thou
forget not the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, in not
keeping his commandments, and his
judgments, and his statutes, which I
command thee this day: lest when
thou hast eaten and art full, and hast
built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;
and when thy herds and thy flocks
multiply, and thy silver and thy gold
is multiplied, and all that thou hast is
multiplied; then thine heart be lifted
up, and thou forget the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God,
which brought thee forth out of the
land of Egypt, from the house of
bondage; who led thee through that
great and terrible wilderness, wherein
were fiery serpents, and scorpions,
and drought, where there was no
water; who brought thee forth water
out of the rock of flint; who fed thee
in the wilderness with manna, which
thy fathers knew not, that he might
humble thee, and that he might prove
thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;
and thou say in thine heart, My power
and the might of mine hand hath gotten
me this wealth. But thou shalt
remember the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God: for it is
he that giveth thee power to get
wealth, that he may establish his covenant
which he sware unto thy fathers,
as it is this day. And it shall
be, if thou do at all forget the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
thy God, and walk after other gods,
and serve them, and worship them, I
testify against you this day that ye
shall surely perish. As the nations
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> destroyeth before
your face, so shall ye perish; because
ye would not be obedient unto the
voice of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God.</p>

<p>Thou hast avouched the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> this
day to be thy God, and to walk in
his ways, and to keep his statutes,
and his commandments, and his judgments,
and to hearken unto his voice:
and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath avouched thee
this day to be his peculiar people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
as he hath promised thee, and that
thou shouldest keep all his commandments;
and to make thee high
above all nations which he hath made,
in praise, and in name, and in honour;
and that thou mayest be an holy people
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, as he hath
spoken.</p>

<p>And Moses charged the people the
same day, saying, These shall stand
upon mount Gerizim to bless the people,
when ye are come over Jordan;
Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and
Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:
and these shall stand upon mount
Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and
Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
And the Levites shall speak,
and say unto all the men of Israel
with a loud voice, Cursed be the man
that maketh any graven or molten image,
an abomination unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
the work of the hands of the craftsman,
and putteth it in a secret place.
And all the people shall answer and
say, Amen. Cursed be he that setteth
light by his father or his mother.
And all the people shall say, Amen.
Cursed be he that removeth his
neighbour's landmark. And all the
people shall say, Amen. Cursed be
he that maketh the blind to wander
out of the way. And all the people
shall say, Amen. Cursed be he that
perverteth the judgment of the stranger,
fatherless, and widow. And all
the people shall say, Amen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deuteronomy 27</div>

<p>And it shall come to pass, if thou
shalt hearken diligently unto the
voice of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, to observe
and to do all his commandments which
I command thee this day, that the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God will set thee on high
above all nations of the earth: and all
these blessings shall come on thee,
and overtake thee, if thou shalt
hearken unto the voice of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
thy God. Blessed shalt thou be in
the city, and blessed shalt thou be in
the field. Blessed shall be the fruit
of thy body, and the fruit of thy
ground, and the fruit of thy cattle,
the increase of thy kine, and the
flocks of thy sheep. Blessed shall be
thy basket and thy store. Blessed
shalt thou be when thou comest in,
and blessed shalt thou be when thou
goest out.</p>

<p>If thou wilt not observe to do all
the words of this law that are written
in this book, that thou mayest fear
this glorious and fearful name, THE
LORD THY GOD; then the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will
make thy plagues wonderful.</p>

<p>And it shall come to pass, when all
these things are come upon thee, the
blessing and the curse, which I have
set before thee, and thou shalt call
them to mind among all the nations,
whither the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God hath driven
thee, and shalt return unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
thy God, and shalt obey his voice according
to all that I command thee
this day, thou and thy children, with
all thine heart, and with all thy soul;
that then the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God will turn
thy captivity, and have compassion
upon thee, and will return and gather
thee from all the nations, whither the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God hath scattered thee.</p>

<p>For this commandment which I
command thee this day, it is not hidden
from thee, neither is it far off.
It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest
say, Who shall go up for us to
heaven, and bring it unto us, that we
may hear it, and do it? Neither is it
beyond the sea, that thou shouldest
say, Who shall go over the sea for us,
and bring it unto us, that we may hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
it, and do it? But the word is very
nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in
thy heart, that thou mayest do it.</p>

<p>See, I have set before thee this
day life and good, and death and evil;
in that I command thee this day to
love the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, to walk in his
ways, and to keep his commandments
and his statutes and his judgments,
that thou mayest live and multiply:
and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God shall bless thee
in the land whither thou goest to possess
it. But if thine heart turn
away, so that thou wilt not hear, but
shalt be drawn away, and worship
other gods, and serve them; I denounce
unto you this day, that ye shall
surely perish, and that ye shall not
prolong your days upon the land,
whither thou passest over Jordan to
go to possess it. I call heaven and
earth to record this day against you,
that I have set before you life and
death, blessing and cursing: therefore
choose life, that both thou and thy
seed may live: that thou mayest love
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, and that thou mayest
obey his voice, and that thou mayest
cleave unto him: for he is thy life,
and the length of thy days: that thou
mayest dwell in the land which the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham,
to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deuteronomy 31</div>

<p>And Moses went and spake these
words unto all Israel. And he said
unto them, I am an hundred and
twenty years old this day; I can no
more go out and come in: also the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath said unto me, Thou shalt
not go over this Jordan. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
thy God, he will go over before thee,
and he will destroy these nations
from before thee, and thou shalt possess
them: and Joshua, he shall go
over before thee, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath
said.</p>

<p>And Moses wrote this law, and delivered
it unto the priests the sons of
Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and unto all the
elders of Israel. And Moses commanded
them, saying, At the end of
every seven years, in the solemnity
of the year of release, in the feast of
tabernacles, when all Israel is come to
appear before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God in
the place which he shall choose, thou
shalt read this law before all Israel in
their hearing. Gather the people together,
men, and women, and children,
and thy stranger that is within
thy gates, that they may hear, and
that they may learn, and fear the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God, and observe to do all
the words of this law: and that their
children, which have not known any
thing, may hear, and learn to fear the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God, as long as ye live in
the land whither ye go over Jordan
to possess it.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, Behold,
thy days approach that thou
must die: call Joshua, and present
yourselves in the tabernacle of the
congregation, that I may give him a
charge. And Moses and Joshua went,
and presented themselves in the tabernacle
of the congregation. And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared in the tabernacle
in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar
of the cloud stood over the door of
the tabernacle. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake
unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,
Get thee up into this mountain Abarim,
unto mount Nebo, which is in the
land of Moab, that is over against
Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan,
which I give unto the children
of Israel for a possession: and die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in the mount whither thou goest up,
and be gathered unto thy people; as
Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor,
and was gathered unto his people: because
ye trespassed against me among
the children of Israel at the waters of
Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness
of Zin; because ye sanctified me not
in the midst of the children of Israel.
Yet thou shalt see the land before
thee; but thou shalt not go thither
unto the land which I give the children
of Israel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deuteronomy 34</div>

<p>And Moses went up from the plains
of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo,
to the top of Pisgah, that is over
against Jericho. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shewed him all the land of Gilead,
unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the
land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and
all the land of Judah, unto the utmost
sea, and the south, and the plain of
the valley of Jericho, the city of palm
trees, unto Zoar. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said
unto him, This is the land which I
sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and
unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto
thy seed: I have caused thee to see it
with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go
over thither.</p>

<p>So Moses the servant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
died there in the land of Moab, according
to the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
he buried him in a valley in the land
of Moab, over against Beth-peor:
but no man knoweth of his sepulchre
unto this day.</p>

<p>And Moses was an hundred and
twenty years old when he died: his
eye was not dim, nor his natural force
abated. And the children of Israel
wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
thirty days: so the days of weeping
and mourning for Moses were ended.
And Joshua the son of Nun was full
of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses
had laid his hands upon him: and the
children of Israel hearkened unto
him, and did as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded
Moses.</p>

<p>And there arose not a prophet since
in Israel like unto Moses, whom the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> knew face to face, in all the
signs and the wonders, which the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> sent him to do in the land of
Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
and to all his land, and in all
that mighty hand, and in all the great
terror which Moses shewed in the
sight of all Israel.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-n.jpg" width="150" height="176" alt="N" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">NOW after the
death of Moses
the servant of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> it came to
pass, that the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto
Joshua the son
of Nun, Moses'
minister, saying,
Moses my servant is dead; now therefore
arise, go over this Jordan, thou,
and all this people, unto the land
which I do give to them, even to the
children of Israel. There shall not
any man be able to stand before thee
all the days of thy life: as I was
with Moses, so I will be with thee: I
will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
Be strong and of a good courage:
for unto this people shalt thou divide
for an inheritance the land,
which I sware unto their fathers
to give them. This book of the law
shall not depart out of thy mouth;
but thou shalt meditate therein day
and night, that thou mayest observe
to do according to all that is
written therein: for then thou shalt
make thy way prosperous, and then
thou shalt have good success. Have
not I commanded thee? Be strong
and of a good courage; be not afraid,
neither be thou dismayed: for the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God is with thee whithersoever
thou goest.</div>

<p>Then Joshua commanded the officers
of the people, saying, Pass
through the host, and command the
people, saying, Prepare you victuals;
for within three days ye shall
pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess
the land, which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your
God giveth you to possess it.</p>

<p>And to the Reubenites, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh,
spake Joshua, saying, Remember
the word which Moses the
servant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded you,
saying, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God hath
given you rest, and hath given you
this land. Your wives, your little
ones, and your cattle, shall remain in
the land which Moses gave you on this
side Jordan; but ye shall pass before
your brethren armed, all the mighty
men of valour, and help them; until
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> have given your brethren
rest, as he hath given you, and they
also have possessed the land which
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God giveth them: then
ye shall return unto the land of your
possession, and enjoy it, which Moses
the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> servant gave you on this
side Jordan toward the sunrising.</p>

<p>And they answered Joshua, saying,
All that thou commandest us we will
do, and whithersoever thou sendest
us, we will go. According as we
hearkened unto Moses in all things, so
will we hearken unto thee: only the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God be with thee, as he was
with Moses. Whosoever he be that
doth rebel against thy commandment,
and will not hearken unto thy words
in all that thou commandest him, he
shall be put to death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joshua 2</div>

<p>And Joshua the son of Nun sent
out of Shittim two men to spy secretly,
saying, Go view the land, even
Jericho. And they went, and came
into the house of a woman named Rahab,
and lodged there. And it was
told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold,
there came men in hither to
night of the children of Israel to
search out the country. And the king
of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying,
Bring forth the men that are come to
thee, which are entered into thine
house: for they be come to search out
all the country. And the woman took
the two men, and hid them, and said
thus, There came men unto me, but I
wist not whence they were: and it
came to pass about the time of shutting
of the gate, when it was dark,
that the men went out: whither the
men went I wot not: pursue after
them quickly; for ye shall overtake
them. But she had brought them up
to the roof of the house, and hid them
with the stalks of flax, which she had
laid in order upon the roof. And the
men pursued after them the way to
Jordan unto the fords: and as soon
as they which pursued after them
were gone out, they shut the gate.</p>

<p>And before they were laid down,
she came up unto them upon the roof;
and she said unto the men, I know
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath given you the land,
and that your terror is fallen upon
us, and that all the inhabitants of the
land faint because of you. For we
have heard how the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> dried up
the water of the Red sea for you,
when ye came out of Egypt; and what
ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites,
that were on the other side
Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly
destroyed. And as soon as we
had heard these things, our hearts did
melt, neither did there remain any
more courage in any man, because of
you: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God, he is God
in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</p>

<p>Now therefore, I pray you, swear
unto me by the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, since I have
shewed you kindness, that ye will
also shew kindness unto my father's
house, and give me a true token: and
that ye will save alive my father, and
my mother, and my brethren, and my
sisters, and all that they have, and deliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
our lives from death. And the
men answered her, Our life for
your's, if ye utter not this our business.
And it shall be, when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
hath given us the land, that we will
deal kindly and truly with thee.
Then she let them down by a cord
through the window: for her house
was upon the town wall, and she dwelt
upon the wall. And she said unto
them, Get you to the mountain, lest
the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves
there three days, until the pursuers
be returned: and afterward may
ye go your way. And the men said
unto her, We will be blameless of this
thine oath which thou hast made us
swear. Behold, when we come into
the land, thou shalt bind this line of
scarlet thread in the window which
thou didst let us down by: and thou
shalt bring thy father, and thy mother,
and thy brethren, and all thy
father's household, home unto thee.
And it shall be, that whosoever shall
go out of the doors of thy house into
the street, his blood shall be upon his
head, and we will be guiltless: and
whosoever shall be with thee in the
house, his blood shall be on our head,
if any hand be upon him. And if thou
utter this our business, then we will
be quit of thine oath which thou hast
made us to swear. And she said, According
unto your words, so be it.
And she sent them away, and they
departed: and she bound the scarlet
line in the window. And they went,
and came unto the mountain, and
abode there three days, until the pursuers
were returned: and the pursuers
sought them throughout all the
way, but found them not.</p>

<p>So the two men returned, and descended
from the mountain, and
passed over, and came to Joshua the
son of Nun, and told him all things
that befell them: and they said unto
Joshua, Truly the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath delivered
into our hands all the land; for
even all the inhabitants of the country
do faint because of us.</p>

<small>THE ISRAELITES PASS OVER
JORDAN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Joshua 3</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Joshua rose early in the
morning; and they removed
from Shittim, and came to
Jordan, he and all the children of Israel,
and lodged there before they
passed over. And it came to pass
after three days, that the officers went
through the host; and they commanded
the people, saying, When ye
see the ark of the covenant of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God, and the priests the
Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove
from your place, and go after
it. Yet there shall be a space between
you and it, about two thousand cubits
by measure: come not near unto it,
that ye may know the way by which
ye must go: for ye have not passed
this way heretofore. And Joshua
said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves:
for to morrow the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will
do wonders among you. And Joshua
spake unto the priests, saying, Take
up the ark of the covenant, and pass
over before the people. And they
took up the ark of the covenant, and
went before the people.</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Joshua,
This day will I begin to magnify thee
in the sight of all Israel, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
may know that, as I was with Moses,
so I will be with thee. And thou shalt
command the priests that bear the
ark of the covenant, saying, When ye
are come to the brink of the water of
Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.</p>

<p>And Joshua said unto the children
of Israel, Come hither, and hear the
words of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God. And
Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know
that the living God is among you.
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the
Lord of all the earth passeth over
before you into Jordan. Now therefore
take you twelve men out of the
tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a
man. And it shall come to pass, as
soon as the soles of the feet of the
priests that bear the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in
the waters of Jordan, that the waters
of Jordan shall be cut off from the
waters that come down from above;
and they shall stand upon an heap.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when the people
removed from their tents, to pass
over Jordan, and the priests bearing
the ark of the covenant before the
people; and as they that bare the ark
were come unto Jordan, and the feet
of the priests that bare the ark were
dipped in the brim of the water, (for
Jordan overfloweth all his banks all
the time of harvest,) that the waters
which came down from above stood
and rose up upon an heap very far
from the city Adam, that is beside
Zaretan: and those that came down
toward the sea of the plain, even the
salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and
the people passed over right against
Jericho. And the priests that bare
the ark of the covenant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
stood firm on dry ground in the midst
of Jordan, and all the Israelites
passed over on dry ground, until all
the people were passed clean over
Jordan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joshua 4</div>

<p>And it came to pass, when all the
people were clean passed over Jordan,
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Joshua,
saying, Take you twelve men out of
the people, out of every tribe a man,
and command ye them, saying, Take
you hence out of the midst of Jordan,
out of the place where the priests'
feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye
shall carry them over with you, and
leave them in the lodging place, where
ye shall lodge this night. Then
Joshua called the twelve men, whom
he had prepared of the children of
Israel, out of every tribe a man: and
Joshua said unto them, Pass over before
the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God
into the midst of Jordan, and take
you up every man of you a stone upon
his shoulder, according unto the
number of the tribes of the children
of Israel. And the children of Israel
did so as Joshua commanded. And
Joshua set up twelve stones in the
midst of Jordan, in the place where
the feet of the priests which bare the
ark of the covenant stood: and they
are there unto this day. For the
priests which bare the ark stood in
the midst of Jordan, until every thing
was finished that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded
Joshua to speak unto the people,
according to all that Moses commanded
Joshua: and the people
hasted and passed over. And the children
of Reuben, and the children of
Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh,
passed over armed before the children
of Israel, as Moses spake unto
them: about forty thousand prepared
for war passed over before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>On that day the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> magnified
Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and
they feared him, as they feared
Moses, all the days of his life. And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Joshua, saying,
Command the priests that bear the
ark of the testimony, that they come
up out of Jordan. Joshua therefore
commanded the priests, saying, Come
ye up out of Jordan. And it came to
pass, when the priests that bare the
ark of the covenant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> were
come up out of the midst of Jordan,
and the soles of the priests' feet were
lifted up unto the dry land, that the
waters of Jordan returned unto their
place, and flowed over all his banks,
as they did before.</p>

<p>And the people came up out of
Jordan on the tenth day of the first
month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the
east border of Jericho. And those
twelve stones, which they took out of
Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.
And he spake unto the children of
Israel, saying, When your children
shall ask their fathers in time to
come, saying, What mean these
stones? then ye shall let your children
know, saying, Israel came over
this Jordan on dry land. For the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God dried up the waters
of Jordan from before you, until ye
were passed over, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your
God did to the Red sea, which he
dried up from before us, until we
were gone over: that all the people of
the earth might know the hand of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that it is mighty: that ye might
fear the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God for ever.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when all the
kings of the Amorites, which were
on the side of Jordan westward, and
all the kings of the Canaanites, which
were by the sea, heard that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
had dried up the waters of Jordan
from before the children of Israel,
until we were passed over, that their
heart melted, neither was there spirit
in them any more, because of the children
of Israel. And the children of
Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept
the passover on the fourteenth day of
the month at even in the plains of
Jericho. And they did eat of the old
corn of the land on the morrow after
the passover, unleavened cakes, and
parched corn in the selfsame day.
And the manna ceased on the morrow
after they had eaten of the old corn
of the land; neither had the children
of Israel manna any more; but they
did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan
that year. And it came to pass,
when Joshua was by Jericho, that he
lifted up his eyes and looked, and,
behold, there stood a man over
against him with his sword drawn in
his hand: and Joshua went unto him,
and said unto him, Art thou for us,
or for our adversaries? And he said,
Nay; but as captain of the host of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> am I now come. And Joshua
fell on his face to the earth, and did
worship, and said unto him, What
saith my lord unto his servant? And
the captain of the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> host said
unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off
thy foot; for the place whereon thou
standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</p>

<small>THE SIEGE OF JERICHO</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Joshua 6</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW Jericho was straitly shut
up because of the children of
Israel: none went out, and
none came in. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
unto Joshua, See, I have given into
thine hand Jericho, and the king
thereof, and the mighty men of valour.
And ye shall compass the city,
all ye men of war, and go round about
the city once. Thus shalt thou do six
days. And seven priests shall bear
before the ark seven trumpets of
rams' horns: and the seventh day ye
shall compass the city seven times,
and the priests shall blow with the
trumpets. And it shall come to pass,
that when they make a long blast with
the ram's horn, and when ye hear the
sound of the trumpet, all the people
shall shout with a great shout; and
the wall of the city shall fall down
flat, and the people shall ascend up
every man straight before him.</div>

<p>And Joshua the son of Nun called
the priests, and said unto them, Take
up the ark of the covenant, and let
seven priests bear seven trumpets of
rams' horns before the ark of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And he said unto the people,
Pass on, and compass the city, and
let him that is armed pass on before
the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And it came to
pass, when Joshua had spoken unto
the people, that the seven priests
bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
horns passed on before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
blew with the trumpets: and the ark
of the covenant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> followed
them. And the armed men went before
the priests that blew with the
trumpets, and the rereward came
after the ark, the priests going on,
and blowing with the trumpets. And
Joshua had commanded the people,
saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make
any noise with your voice, neither
shall any word proceed out of your
mouth, until the day I bid you shout;
then shall ye shout. So the ark of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> compassed the city, going about
it once: and they came into the camp,
and lodged in the camp.</p>

<p>And Joshua rose early in the morning,
and the priests took up the ark of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And seven priests bearing
seven trumpets of rams' horns before
the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> went on continually,
and blew with the trumpets: and
the armed men went before them;
but the rereward came after the ark
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the priests going on, and
blowing with the trumpets. And the
second day they compassed the city
once, and returned into the camp:
so they did six days. And it came to
pass on the seventh day, that they
rose early about the dawning of the
day, and compassed the city after the
same manner seven times: only on
that day they compassed the city
seven times.</p>

<p>And it came to pass at the seventh
time, when the priests blew with the
trumpets, Joshua said unto the people,
Shout; for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath given
you the city. And the city shall be
accursed, even it, and all that are
therein, to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: only Rahab shall
live, she and all that are with her in
the house, because she hid the messengers
that we sent. And ye, in any
wise keep yourselves from the accursed
thing, lest ye make yourselves
accursed, when ye take of the accursed
thing, and make the camp of
Israel a curse, and trouble it. But
all the silver, and gold, and vessels
of brass and iron, are consecrated
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: they shall come into
the treasury of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>So the people shouted when the
priests blew with the trumpets: and
it came to pass, when the people
heard the sound of the trumpet, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the people shouted with a great shout,
that the wall fell down flat, so that
the people went up into the city,
every man straight before him, and
they took the city. And they utterly
destroyed all that was in the city,
both man and woman, young and old,
and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the
edge of the sword. And Joshua
saved Rahab alive, and her father's
household, and all that she had; and
she dwelleth in Israel even unto this
day; because she hid the messengers,
which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</p>

<p>And Joshua adjured them at that
time, saying, Cursed be the man before
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that riseth up and
buildeth this city Jericho: he shall
lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn,
and in his youngest son shall he
set up the gates of it.</p>

<p>So the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was with Joshua; and
his fame was noised throughout all
the country.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_64" id="CHAPTER_64">CHAPTER 64</a><br />

<small>THE TRESPASS OF ACHAN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Joshua 7</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>BUT the children of Israel committed
a trespass in the accursed
thing: for Achan, the
son of Carmi, of the tribe of Judah,
took of the accursed thing: and the
anger of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was kindled against
the children of Israel. And Joshua
sent men from Jericho to Ai, which
is beside Beth-aven, on the east side
of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying,
Go up and view the country. And
the men went up and viewed Ai.
And they returned to Joshua, and
said unto him, Let not all the people
go up; but let about two or three
thousand men go up and smite Ai;
and make not all the people to labour
thither; for they are but few. So
there went up thither of the people
about three thousand men: and they
fled before the men of Ai. And the
men of Ai smote of them about
thirty and six men: for they chased
them from before the gate even unto
Shebarim, and smote them in the going
down: wherefore the hearts of
the people melted, and became as
water.</div>

<p>And Joshua rent his clothes, and
fell to the earth upon his face before
the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> until the eventide,
he and the elders of Israel, and
put dust upon their heads. And
Joshua said, Alas, O Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>, wherefore
hast thou at all brought this people
over Jordan, to deliver us into
the hand of the Amorites, to destroy
us? would to God we had been content,
and dwelt on the other side
Jordan! O Lord, what shall I say,
when Israel turneth their backs before
their enemies! For the Canaanites
and all the inhabitants of the land
shall hear of it, and shall environ us
round, and cut off our name from the
earth: and what wilt thou do unto
thy great name?</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Joshua,
Get thee up; wherefore liest thou
thus upon thy face? Israel hath
sinned, and they have also transgressed
my covenant which I commanded
them: for they have even
taken of the accursed thing, and have
also stolen, and dissembled also, and
they have put it even among their
own stuff. Therefore the children of
Israel could not stand before their
enemies, but turned their backs before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
their enemies, because they
were accursed: neither will I be with
you any more, except ye destroy the
accursed from among you. Up, sanctify
the people, and say, Sanctify
yourselves against to morrow: for
thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel,
There is an accursed thing in the
midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not
stand before thine enemies, until ye
take away the accursed thing from
among you. In the morning therefore
ye shall be brought according to
your tribes: and it shall be, that the
tribe which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> taketh shall
come according to the families thereof;
and the family which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shall take shall come by households;
and the household which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shall take shall come man by man.
And it shall be, that he that is taken
with the accursed thing shall be burnt
with fire, he and all that he hath:
because he hath transgressed the covenant
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and because he
hath wrought folly in Israel.</p>

<p>So Joshua rose up early in the
morning, and brought Israel by their
tribes; and the tribe of Judah was
taken: and he brought the family
of Judah; and he took the family of
the Zarhites: and he brought the family
of the Zarhites man by man; and
Zabdi was taken: and he brought his
household man by man; and Achan,
the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi,
the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah,
was taken. And Joshua said
unto Achan, My son, give, I pray
thee, glory to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel,
and make confession unto him; and
tell me now what thou hast done;
hide it not from me. And Achan answered
Joshua, and said, Indeed I
have sinned against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of
Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
when I saw among the spoils a goodly
Babylonish garment, and two hundred
shekels of silver, and a wedge
of gold of fifty shekels weight, then
I coveted them, and took them; and,
behold, they are hid in the earth in
the midst of my tent, and the silver
under it.</p>

<p>So Joshua sent messengers, and
they ran unto the tent; and, behold,
it was hid in his tent, and the silver
under it. And they took them out of
the midst of the tent, and brought
them unto Joshua, and unto all the
children of Israel, and laid them out
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Joshua, and
all Israel with him, took Achan the son
of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment,
and the wedge of gold, and his
sons, and his daughters, and his oxen,
and his asses, and his sheep, and his
tent, and all that he had: and they
brought them unto the valley of
Achor. And Joshua said, Why hast
thou troubled us? the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall
trouble thee this day. And all Israel
stoned him with stones, and burned
them with fire, after they had stoned
them with stones. And they raised
over him a great heap of stones unto
this day. So the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> turned from
the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore
the name of that place was called,
The valley of Achor, unto this day.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_65" id="CHAPTER_65">CHAPTER 65</a><br />

<small>THE CAPTURE OF AI</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Joshua 8</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Joshua,
Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:
take all the people of
war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
see, I have given into thy hand the
king of Ai, and his people, and his
city, and his land: and thou shalt do
to Ai and her king as thou didst unto
Jericho and her king: only the spoil
thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall
ye take for a prey unto yourselves:
lay thee an ambush for the city behind
it.</div>

<p>So Joshua arose, and all the people
of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua
chose out thirty thousand mighty men
of valour, and sent them away by
night. And he commanded them,
saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
against the city, even behind the city:
go not very far from the city, but be
ye all ready: and I, and all the people
that are with me, will approach unto
the city: and it shall come to pass,
when they come out against us, as at
the first, that we will flee before them,
(for they will come out after us) till
we have drawn them from the city;
for they will say, They flee before us,
as at the first: therefore we will flee
before them. Then ye shall rise up
from the ambush, and seize upon the
city: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God will deliver
it into your hand. And it shall
be, when ye have taken the city, that
ye shall set the city on fire: according
to the commandment of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall
ye do. See, I have commanded you.</p>

<p>Joshua therefore sent them forth:
and they went to lie in ambush, and
abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the
west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged
that night among the people. And
Joshua rose up early in the morning,
and numbered the people, and went
up, he and the elders of Israel, before
the people to Ai. And all the people,
even the people of war that were with
him, went up, and drew nigh, and
came before the city, and pitched on
the north side of Ai: now there was
a valley between them and Ai. And
he took about five thousand men, and
set them to lie in ambush between
Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the
city. And when they had set the people,
even all the host that was on the
north of the city, and their liers in
wait on the west of the city, Joshua
went that night into the midst of the
valley.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when the king
of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose
up early, and the men of the city
went out against Israel to battle, he
and all his people, at a time appointed,
before the plain; but he wist
not that there were liers in ambush
against him behind the city. And
Joshua and all Israel made as if they
were beaten before them, and fled
by the way of the wilderness. And
all the people that were in Ai were
called together to pursue after them:
and they pursued after Joshua, and
were drawn away from the city. And
there was not a man left in Ai or
Beth-el, that went not out after Israel:
and they left the city open, and
pursued after Israel. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
said unto Joshua, Stretch out the
spear that is in thy hand toward Ai;
for I will give it into thine hand.
And Joshua stretched out the spear
that he had in his hand toward the
city. And the ambush arose quickly
out of their place, and they ran as
soon as he had stretched out his hand:
and they entered into the city, and
took it, and hasted and set the city on
fire. And when the men of Ai looked
behind them, they saw, and, behold,
the smoke of the city ascended up to
heaven, and they had no power to flee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
this way or that way: and the people
that fled to the wilderness turned
back upon the pursuers. And when
Joshua and all Israel saw that the
ambush had taken the city, and that
the smoke of the city ascended, then
they turned again, and slew the men
of Ai. And the other issued out of
the city against them; so they were
in the midst of Israel, some on this
side, and some on that side: and they
smote them, so that they let none of
them remain or escape. And the king
of Ai they took alive, and brought
him to Joshua. And it came to pass,
when Israel had made an end of slaying
all the inhabitants of Ai in the
field, in the wilderness wherein they
chased them, and when they were all
fallen on the edge of the sword, until
they were consumed, that all the Israelites
returned unto Ai, and smote
it with the edge of the sword. And so
it was, that all that fell that day were
twelve thousand, even all the men of
Ai. For Joshua drew not his hand
back, wherewith he stretched out the
spear, until he had utterly destroyed
all the inhabitants of Ai. Only the
cattle and the spoil of that city Israel
took for a prey unto themselves, according
unto the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
which he commanded Joshua. And
Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap
for ever, even a desolation unto this
day. And the king of Ai he hanged
on a tree until eventide: and as soon
as the sun was down, Joshua commanded
that they should take his carcase
down from the tree, and cast
it at the entering of the gate of the
city, and raise thereon a great heap
of stones, that remaineth unto this
day.</p>

<p>Then Joshua built an altar unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel in mount Ebal, as
Moses the servant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded
the children of Israel, as it
is written in the book of the law of
Moses, an altar of whole stones, over
which no man hath lift up any iron:
and they offered thereon burnt offerings
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and sacrificed
peace offerings. And he wrote there
upon the stones a copy of the law of
Moses, which he wrote in the presence
of the children of Israel. And all
Israel, and their elders, and officers,
and their judges, stood on this side
the ark and on that side before the
priests the Levites, which bare the
ark of the covenant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, as
well the stranger, as he that was born
among them; half of them over
against mount Gerizim, and half of
them over against mount Ebal; as
Moses the servant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had
commanded before, that they should
bless the people of Israel. And afterward
he read all the words of the
law, the blessings and cursings, according
to all that is written in the
book of the law. There was not a
word of all that Moses commanded,
which Joshua read not before all the
congregation of Israel, with the women,
and the little ones, and the
strangers that were conversant among
them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_66" id="CHAPTER_66">CHAPTER 66</a><br />

<small>THE CRAFT OF THE GIBEONITES</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Joshua 9</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, when all the
kings which were on this side
Jordan, in the hills, and in the
valleys, and in all the coasts of the
great sea over against Lebanon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
heard thereof; that they gathered
themselves together, to fight with
Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
And when the inhabitants of
Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
unto Jericho and to Ai, they did work
wilily, and went and made as if they
had been ambassadors, and took old
sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles,
old, and rent, and bound up; and
old shoes and clouted upon their feet,
and old garments upon them; and
all the bread of their provision was
dry and mouldy. And they went
to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal,
and said unto him, and to the men of
Israel, We be come from a far country:
now therefore make ye a league
with us. And the men of Israel said
unto them, Peradventure ye dwell
among us; and how shall we make a
league with you? And they said unto
Joshua, We are thy servants. And
Joshua said unto them, Who are ye?
and from whence come ye? And they
said unto him, From a very far country
thy servants are come because of
the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God: for we
have heard the fame of him, and all
that he did in Egypt, and all that he
did to the two kings of the Amorites,
that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon
king of Heshbon, and to Og king of
Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.
Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants
of our country spake to us,
saying, Take victuals with you for the
journey, and go to meet them, and say
unto them, We are your servants:
therefore now make ye a league with
us. This our bread we took hot for
our provision out of our houses on the
day we came forth to go unto you; but
now, behold, it is dry, and it is
mouldy: and these bottles of wine,
which we filled, were new; and, behold,
they be rent: and these our garments
and our shoes are become old
by reason of the very long journey.
And the men took of their victuals,
and asked not counsel at the mouth of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Joshua made peace
with them, and made a league with
them, to let them live: and the princes
of the congregation sware unto them.</div>

<p>And it came to pass at the end of
three days after they had made a
league with them, that they heard
that they were their neighbours, and
that they dwelt among them. And
the children of Israel journeyed, and
came unto their cities on the third
day. Now their cities were Gibeon,
and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and
Kirjath-jearim. And the children
of Israel smote them not, because the
princes of the congregation had
sworn unto them by the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of
Israel. And all the congregation
murmured against the princes. But
all the princes said unto all the congregation,
We have sworn unto them
by the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel: now therefore
we may not touch them. This
we will do to them; we will even let
them live, lest wrath be upon us, because
of the oath which we sware unto
them; but let them be hewers of wood
and drawers of water unto all the congregation.</p>

<p>And Joshua called for them, and he
spake unto them, saying, Wherefore
have ye beguiled us, saying, We are
very far from you; when ye dwell
among us? Now therefore ye are
cursed, and there shall none of you be
freed from being bondmen, and hewers
of wood and drawers of water for
the house of my God. And they answered
Joshua, and said, Because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
was certainly told thy servants, how
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God commanded his
servant Moses to give you all the land,
and to destroy all the inhabitants of
the land from before you, therefore
we were sore afraid of our lives because
of you, and have done this
thing. And now, behold, we are in
thine hand: as it seemeth good and
right unto thee to do unto us, do. And
so did he unto them, and delivered
them out of the hand of the children
of Israel, that they slew them not.
And Joshua made them that day hewers
of wood and drawers of water for
the congregation, and for the altar of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, even unto this day, in the
place which he should choose.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_67" id="CHAPTER_67">CHAPTER 67</a><br />

<small>JOSHUA CONQUERS THE KINGS
OF CANAAN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Joshua 10</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW it came to pass, when
Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem
had heard how Joshua
had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed
it; and how the inhabitants of
Gibeon had made peace with Israel,
and were among them; that they
feared greatly, because Gibeon was a
great city, as one of the royal cities,
and because it was greater than Ai,
and all the men thereof were mighty.
Wherefore Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem
sent unto the kings of Hebron,
Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon, saying,
Come up unto me, and help me, that
we may smite Gibeon: for it hath
made peace with Joshua and with the
children of Israel. Therefore the five
kings of the Amorites gathered themselves
together, and went up, they
and all their hosts, and encamped before
Gibeon, and made war against
it. And the men of Gibeon sent unto
Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying,
Slack not thy hand from thy servants;
come up to us quickly, and save us,
and help us: for all the kings of the
Amorites that dwell in the mountains
are gathered together against us. So
Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and
all the people of war with him, and
all the mighty men of valour. And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Joshua, Fear them
not: for I have delivered them into
thine hand; there shall not a man of
them stand before thee. Joshua
therefore came unto them suddenly,
and went up from Gilgal all night.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> discomfited them before
Israel, and slew them with a
great slaughter at Gibeon. And it
came to pass, as they fled from before
Israel, and were in the going down
to Beth-horon, that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> cast
down great stones from heaven upon
them unto Azekah, and they died:
they were more which died with hailstones
than they whom the children of
Israel slew with the sword.</div>

<p>Then spake Joshua to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in
the day when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> delivered up
the Amorites before the children of
Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel,
Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon;
and thou, Moon, in the valley
of Ajalon. And the sun stood still,
and the moon stayed, until the people
had avenged themselves upon their
enemies. Is not this written in the
book of Jasher? So the sun stood still
in the midst of heaven, and hasted
not to go down about a whole day.
And there was no day like that before
it or after it, that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hearkened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
unto the voice of a man: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
fought for Israel.</p>

<p>And Joshua returned, and all Israel
with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
But these five kings fled, and
hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
And it was told Joshua, saying,
The five kings are found hid in a cave
at Makkedah. And Joshua said, Roll
great stones upon the mouth of the
cave, and set men by it for to keep
them: and stay ye not, but pursue
after your enemies, and smite the
hindmost of them; suffer them not to
enter into their cities: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
your God hath delivered them into
your hand. And it came to pass,
when Joshua and the children of Israel
had made an end of slaying them
with a very great slaughter, till they
were consumed, that the rest which
remained of them entered into fenced
cities. And all the people returned
to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah
in peace: none moved his tongue
against any of the children of Israel.
Then said Joshua, Open the mouth
of the cave, and bring out those five
kings unto me out of the cave. And
they did so, and brought forth those
five kings unto him out of the cave.
And it came to pass, when they
brought out those kings unto Joshua,
that Joshua called for all the men of
Israel, and said unto the captains of
the men of war which went with him,
Come near, put your feet upon the
necks of these kings. And they came
near, and put their feet upon the
necks of them. And Joshua said unto
them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be
strong and of good courage: for thus
shall the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> do to all your enemies
against whom ye fight. And afterward
Joshua smote them, and slew
them, and hanged them on five trees:
and they were hanging upon the trees
until the evening. And it came to
pass at the time of the going down of
the sun, that Joshua commanded, and
they took them down off the trees, and
cast them into the cave wherein they
had been hid, and laid great stones in
the cave's mouth, which remain until
this very day.</p>

<p>So Joshua smote all the country of
the hills, and of the south, and of the
vale, and of the springs, and all their
kings: he left none remaining, but
utterly destroyed all that breathed,
as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel commanded.
And Joshua smote them from
Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and
all the country of Goshen, even unto
Gibeon. And all these kings and
their land did Joshua take at one
time, because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel
fought for Israel. And Joshua smote
one and thirty kings in all, and took
the whole land, and gave it for an inheritance
unto Israel.</p>

<small>JOSHUA DIVIDES THE LAND</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Joshua 14</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THESE are the countries which
the children of Israel inherited
in the land of Canaan,
which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
the son of Nun, and the heads of the
fathers of the tribes of the children
of Israel, distributed for inheritance
to them. By lot was their inheritance,
as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded by the hand
of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for
the half tribe. For Moses had given
the inheritance of two tribes and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
half tribe on the other side Jordan:
but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance
among them. For the children
of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh
and Ephraim: therefore they
gave no part unto the Levites in the
land, save cities to dwell in, with their
suburbs for their cattle and for their
substance. As the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded
Moses, so the children of Israel did,
and they divided the land.</div>

<p>Then the children of Judah came
unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the
son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said
unto him, Thou knowest the thing
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses the
man of God concerning me and thee
in Kadesh-barnea. Forty years old
was I when Moses the servant of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> sent me from Kadesh-barnea
to espy out the land; and I brought
him word again as it was in mine
heart. Nevertheless my brethren
that went up with me made the heart
of the people melt: but I wholly followed
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my God. And Moses
sware on that day, saying, Surely the
land whereon thy feet have trodden
shall be thine inheritance, and thy
children's for ever, because thou hast
wholly followed the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my God.
And now, behold, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath kept
me alive, as he said, these forty and
five years, even since the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake
this word unto Moses, while the children
of Israel wandered in the wilderness:
and now, lo, I am this day
fourscore and five years old. As yet
I am as strong this day as I was in
the day that Moses sent me: as my
strength was then, even so is my
strength now, for war, both to go out,
and to come in. Now therefore give
me this mountain, whereof the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
spake in that day; for thou heardest
in that day how the Anakims were
there, and that the cities were great
and fenced: if so be the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will be
with me, then I shall be able to drive
them out, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said. And
Joshua blessed him, and gave unto
Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron
for an inheritance. Hebron therefore
became the inheritance of Caleb the
son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto
this day, because that he wholly followed
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel. And
the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba;
which Arba was a great
man among the Anakims. And the
land had rest from war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joshua 15</div>

<p>This then was the lot of the tribe of
the children of Judah by their families;
even to the border of Edom the
wilderness of Zin southward was the
uttermost part of the south coast.
And their south border was from the
shore of the salt sea, from the bay that
looketh southward: and the east border
was the salt sea, even unto the
end of Jordan. And their border in
the north quarter was from the bay of
the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:
and the border went up by the
valley of the son of Hinnom unto the
south side of the Jebusite; the same
is Jerusalem: and the west border
was to the great sea, and the coast
thereof. This is the coast of the children
of Judah round about according
to their families. As for the Jebusites
the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
the children of Judah could not drive
them out: but the Jebusites dwell with
the children of Judah at Jerusalem
unto this day.</p>

<p>And the lot of the children of Joseph
fell from Jordan by Jericho,
unto the water of Jericho on the east,
to the wilderness that goeth up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Jericho throughout mount Beth-el,
and goeth out from Beth-el to Luz,
unto the coast of Beth-horon the
nether, and to Gezer: and the goings
out thereof are at the sea. So the
children of Joseph, Manasseh and
Ephraim, took their inheritance. And
they drave not out the Canaanites
that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites
dwell among the Ephraimites
unto this day, and serve under tribute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joshua 18</div>

<p>And the whole congregation of the
children of Israel assembled together
at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle
of the congregation there. And the
land was subdued before them. And
there remained among the children of
Israel seven tribes, which had not yet
received their inheritance. And
Joshua said unto the children of Israel,
How long are ye slack to go to
possess the land, which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God
of your fathers hath given you? Give
out from among you three men for
each tribe: and I will send them, and
they shall rise, and go through the
land, and describe it according to the
inheritance of them; and they shall
come again to me. And they shall
divide it into seven parts: Judah shall
abide in their coast on the south, and
the house of Joseph shall abide in
their coasts on the north. Ye shall
therefore describe the land into seven
parts, and bring the description hither
to me, that I may cast lots for you
here before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God. But
the Levites have no part among you;
for the priesthood of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is their
inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben,
and half the tribe of Manasseh, have
received their inheritance beyond
Jordan on the east, which Moses the
servant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> gave them. And
the men arose, and went away: and
Joshua charged them that went to describe
the land, saying, Go and walk
through the land, and describe it, and
come again to me, that I may here
cast lots for you before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in
Shiloh. And the men went and passed
through the land, and described it by
cities into seven parts in a book, and
came again to Joshua to the host at
Shiloh. And Joshua cast lots for
them in Shiloh before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and
there Joshua divided the land unto
the children of Israel according to
their divisions.</p>

<p>When they had made an end of dividing
the land for inheritance by
their coasts, the children of Israel
gave an inheritance to Joshua the
son of Nun among them: according
to the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> they gave him
the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah
in mount Ephraim: and
he built the city, and dwelt therein.
So they made an end of dividing the
country. Then the children of Israel
appointed six cities of refuge, three
on each side of Jordan, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
commanded. And forty and eight
cities with their suburbs they set
apart by lot, out of the inheritance of
other tribes, for the tribe of Levi.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> gave unto Israel all
the land which he sware to give unto
their fathers; and they possessed it,
and dwelt therein. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
gave them rest round about, according
to all that he sware unto their fathers:
and there stood not a man of
all their enemies before them; the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> delivered all their enemies into
their hand. There failed not ought
of any good thing which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had
spoken unto the house of Israel; all
came to pass.</p>

<p>Then Joshua called the Reubenites,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and the Gadites, and the half tribe of
Manasseh, and said unto them, Ye
have kept all that Moses the servant
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded you, and
have obeyed my voice in all that I
commanded you: ye have not left
your brethren these many days unto
this day, but have kept the charge of
the commandment of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your
God. And now the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God
hath given rest unto your brethren,
as he promised them: therefore now
return ye, and get you unto your
tents, and unto the land of your possession,
which Moses the servant of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> gave you on the other side
Jordan. But take diligent heed to do
the commandment and the law, which
Moses the servant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
charged you, to love the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your
God, and to walk in all his ways, and
to keep his commandments, and to
cleave unto him, and to serve him
with all your heart and with all your
soul. So Joshua blessed them, and
sent them away: and they went unto
their tents.</p>

<small>THE PEOPLE RENEW THE
COVENANT</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Joshua 23</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass a long time
after that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had given
rest unto Israel from all their
enemies round about, that Joshua
waxed old and stricken in age. And
Joshua called for all Israel, and for
their elders, and for their heads, and
for their judges, and for their officers,
and said unto them, I am old and
stricken in age: and ye have seen all
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God hath done
unto all these nations because of you;
for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God is he that hath
fought for you. Behold, I have divided
unto you by lot these nations
that remain, to be an inheritance for
your tribes, from Jordan, with all the
nations that I have cut off, even unto
the great sea westward. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God, he shall expel them
from before you, and drive them from
out of your sight; and ye shall possess
their land, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God
hath promised unto you. Be ye therefore
very courageous to keep and to
do all that is written in the book of
the law of Moses, that ye turn not
aside therefrom to the right hand or
to the left; that ye come not among
these nations, these that remain
among you; neither make mention of
the name of their gods, nor cause to
swear by them, neither serve them,
nor bow yourselves unto them: but
cleave unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God, as ye
have done unto this day.</div>

<p>And, behold, this day I am going
the way of all the earth: and ye know
in all your hearts and in all your
souls, that not one thing hath failed
of all the good things which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
your God spake concerning you; all
are come to pass unto you, and not
one thing hath failed thereof. Therefore
it shall come to pass, that as all
good things are come upon you, which
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God promised you; so
shall the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> bring upon you all evil
things, until he have destroyed you
from off this good land which the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God hath given you.
When ye have transgressed the covenant
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God, which he
commanded you, and have gone and
served other gods, and bowed yourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to them; then shall the anger
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> be kindled against you,
and ye shall perish quickly from off
the good land which he hath given
unto you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joshua 24</div>

<p>And Joshua gathered all the tribes
of Israel to Shechem, and called for
the elders of Israel, and for their
heads, and for their judges, and for
their officers; and they presented
themselves before God. And Joshua
said unto all the people, Thus saith
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel, Your fathers
dwelt on the other side of the flood in
old time, even Terah, the father of
Abraham, and the father of Nachor:
and they served other gods. And I
took your father Abraham from the
other side of the flood, and led him
throughout all the land of Canaan,
and multiplied his seed, and gave
him Isaac. And I gave unto Isaac
Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto
Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but
Jacob and his children went down
into Egypt. I sent Moses also and
Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according
to that which I did among
them: and afterward I brought you
out. And I brought your fathers out
of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea;
and the Egyptians pursued after
your fathers with chariots and horsemen
unto the Red sea. And when
they cried unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, he put
darkness between you and the Egyptians,
and brought the sea upon them,
and covered them; and your eyes
have seen what I have done in Egypt:
and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long
season. And I brought you into the
land of the Amorites, which dwelt on
the other side Jordan; and they
fought with you: and I gave them
into your hand, that ye might possess
their land; and I destroyed them
from before you. Then Balak the
son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose
and warred against Israel, and sent
and called Balaam the son of Beor to
curse you: but I would not hearken
unto Balaam; therefore he blessed
you still: so I delivered you out of
his hand. And ye went over Jordan,
and came unto Jericho: and the men
of Jericho fought against you, the
Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the
Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites;
and I delivered them into your
hand. And I sent the hornet before
you, which drave them out from before
you, even the two kings of the
Amorites; but not with thy sword,
nor with thy bow. And I have given
you a land for which ye did not
labour, and cities which ye built
not, and ye dwell in them; of the
vineyards and oliveyards which ye
planted not do ye eat.</p>

<p>Now therefore fear the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
serve him in sincerity and in truth:
and put away the gods which your
fathers served on the other side of the
flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And if it seem evil unto you
to serve the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, choose you this day
whom ye will serve; whether the gods
which your fathers served that were
on the other side of the flood, or the
gods of the Amorites, in whose land
ye dwell: but as for me and my house,
we will serve the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the people
answered and said, God forbid
that we should forsake the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to
serve other gods. And Joshua said
unto the people, Ye cannot serve the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>: for he is an holy God; he is a
jealous God; he will not forgive your
transgressions nor your sins. If ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
forsake the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and serve strange
gods, then he will turn and do you
hurt, and consume you, after that he
hath done you good. And the people
said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will
serve the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Joshua said
unto the people, Ye are witnesses
against yourselves that ye have
chosen you the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to serve him.
And they said, We are witnesses.
Now therefore put away, said he, the
strange gods which are among you,
and incline your heart unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
God of Israel. And the people said
unto Joshua, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God will
we serve, and his voice will we obey.
So Joshua made a covenant with the
people that day, and set them a statute
and an ordinance in Shechem.</p>

<p>And Joshua wrote these words in
the book of the law of God, and took
a great stone, and set it up there
under an oak, that was by the sanctuary
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Joshua said
unto all the people, Behold, this stone
shall be a witness unto us; for it hath
heard all the words of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> which
he spake unto us: it shall be therefore
a witness unto you, lest ye deny your
God. So Joshua let the people depart,
every man unto his inheritance.</p>

<p>And it came to pass after these
things, that Joshua the son of Nun,
the servant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, died, being
an hundred and ten years old. And
they buried him in the border of his
inheritance in Timnath-serah, which
is in mount Ephraim, on the north
side of the hill of Gaash. And Israel
served the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> all the days of
Joshua, and all the days of the elders
that overlived Joshua, and which had
known all the works of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that
he had done for Israel.</p>

<p>And the bones of Joseph, which
the children of Israel brought up out
of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in
a parcel of ground which Jacob
bought of the sons of Hamor the father
of Shechem for an hundred
pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance
of the children of Joseph.
And Eleazar the son of Aaron died;
and they buried him in a hill that pertained
to Phinehas his son, which was
given him in mount Ephraim.</p>

<p>And also all that generation were
gathered unto their fathers: and
there arose another generation after
them, which knew not the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, nor
yet the works which he had done for
Israel.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_70" id="CHAPTER_70">CHAPTER 70</a><br />

<small>THE ISRAELITES FORSAKE GOD</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Judges 2</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the children of Israel did
evil in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and served Baalim: and they
forsook the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of their fathers,
which brought them out of the land of
Egypt, and followed other gods, of
the gods of the people that were
round about them, and bowed themselves
unto them, and provoked the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> to anger. And they forsook the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
And the anger of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was hot
against Israel, and he delivered them
into the hands of spoilers that spoiled
them, and he sold them into the hands
of their enemies round about, so that
they could not any longer stand before
their enemies. Whithersoever
they went out, the hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
was against them for evil, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
had said, and as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had sworn
unto them: and they were greatly distressed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Nevertheless the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> raised
up judges, which delivered them out
of the hand of those that spoiled
them.</div>

<p>And when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> raised them up
judges, then the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was with the
judge, and delivered them out of the
hand of their enemies all the days of
the judge: for it repented the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
because of their groanings by reason
of them that oppressed them and
vexed them. And it came to pass,
when the judge was dead, that they
returned, and corrupted themselves
more than their fathers, in following
other gods to serve them, and to bow
down unto them; they ceased not from
their own doings, nor from their stubborn
way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Judges 3</div>

<p>And the anger of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was hot
against Israel; and he said, Because
that this people hath transgressed my
covenant which I commanded their fathers,
and have not hearkened unto my
voice; I also will not henceforth drive
out any from before them of the nations
which Joshua left when he died:
that through them I may prove Israel,
whether they will keep the way of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> to walk therein, as their fathers
did keep it, or not. Therefore the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> left those nations, without driving
them out hastily; neither delivered
he them into the hand of Joshua.
Now these are the nations which the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> left, to prove Israel; namely,
five lords of the Philistines, and all
the Canaanites, and the Sidonians,
and the Hivites that dwelt in mount
Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon
unto the entering in of Hamath. And
they were to prove Israel by them, to
know whether they would hearken
unto the commandments of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
which he commanded their fathers by
the hand of Moses. And the children
of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites,
Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites,
and Hivites, and Jebusites: and
they took their daughters to be their
wives, and gave their daughters to
their sons, and served their gods.
And the children of Israel did evil in
the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and forgat the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> their God, and served Baalim
and the groves. Therefore the anger
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was hot against Israel,
and he sold them into the hand of the
king of Mesopotamia: and the children
of Israel served him eight years.
And when the children of Israel cried
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> raised up a
deliverer, who delivered them, even
Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's
younger brother. And the Spirit of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came upon him, and he
judged Israel, and went out to war:
and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> delivered the king of
Mesopotamia into his hand. And the
land had rest forty years. And Othniel
the son of Kenaz died.</p>

<p>And the children of Israel did evil
again in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> strengthened Eglon the king of
Moab against Israel, because they had
done evil in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
And he gathered unto him the children
of Ammon and Amalek, and
went and smote Israel, and possessed
the city of palm trees. So the children
of Israel served Eglon the king
of Moab eighteen years. But when
the children of Israel cried unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> raised them up a deliverer,
Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite,
a man lefthanded. And after
him was Shamgar, which slew of the
Philistines six hundred men with an
ox goad: and he also delivered
Israel.</p>

<small>DEBORAH AND BARAK DELIVER
ISRAEL</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Judges 4</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the children of Israel again
did evil in the sight of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, when Ehud was dead.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> sold them into the hand
of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned
in Hazor; the captain of whose host
was Sisera. And the children of Israel
cried unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: for he had
nine hundred chariots of iron; and
twenty years he mightily oppressed
the children of Israel.</div>

<p>And Deborah, a prophetess, the
wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at
that time. And she dwelt under the
palm tree of Deborah between Ramah
and Beth-el in mount Ephraim: and
the children of Israel came up to her
for judgment. And she sent and called
Barak the son of Abinoam out of
Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him,
Hath not the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel commanded,
saying, Go and draw toward
mount Tabor, and take with thee ten
thousand men of the children of Naphtali
and of the children of Zebulun?
And I will draw unto thee to the river
Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's
army, with his chariots and his multitude;
and I will deliver him into thine
hand. And Barak said unto her, If
thou wilt go with me, then I will go:
but if thou wilt not go with me, then
I will not go. And she said, I will
surely go with thee: notwithstanding
the journey that thou takest shall not
be for thine honour; for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shall sell Sisera into the hand of a
woman. And Deborah arose, and
went with Barak to Kedesh.</p>

<p>And Barak called Zebulun and
Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up
with ten thousand men at his feet: and
Deborah went up with him. Now Heber
the Kenite, which was of the children
of Hobab the father in law of
Moses, had severed himself from the
Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the
plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.
And they shewed Sisera that Barak
the son of Abinoam was gone up to
mount Tabor. And Sisera gathered
together all his chariots, even nine
hundred chariots of iron, and all the
people that were with him, from Harosheth
of the Gentiles unto the river
of Kishon. And Deborah said unto
Barak, Up; for this is the day in
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath delivered Sisera
into thine hand: is not the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> gone
out before thee? So Barak went
down from mount Tabor, and ten
thousand men after him. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> discomfited Sisera, and all his
chariots, and all his host, with the
edge of the sword before Barak; so
that Sisera lighted down off his chariot,
and fled away on his feet. But
Barak pursued after the chariots, and
after the host, unto Harosheth of the
Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera
fell upon the edge of the sword; and
there was not a man left. Howbeit
Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent
of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite:
for there was peace between Jabin
the king of Hazor and the house of
Heber the Kenite.</p>

<p>And Jael went out to meet Sisera,
and said unto him, Turn in, my lord,
turn in to me; fear not. And when he
had turned in unto her into the tent,
she covered him with a mantle. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
he said unto her, Give me, I pray
thee, a little water to drink; for I am
thirsty. And she opened a bottle of
milk, and gave him drink, and covered
him. Again he said unto her, Stand
in the door of the tent, and it shall be,
when any man doth come and enquire
of thee, and say, Is there any man
here? that thou shalt say, No. Then
Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the
tent, and took an hammer in her hand,
and went softly unto him, and smote
the nail into his temples, and fastened
it into the ground: for he was fast
asleep and weary. So he died. And,
behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael
came out to meet him, and said unto
him, Come, and I will shew thee the
man whom thou seekest. And when
he came into her tent, behold, Sisera
lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.
So God subdued on that day
Jabin the king of Canaan before the
children of Israel. And the hand of
the children of Israel prospered, and
prevailed against Jabin the king of
Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin
king of Canaan.</p>

<p>Then sang Deborah on that day,
saying, Blessed above women shall
Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,
blessed shall she be above women in
the tent. He asked water, and she
gave him milk; she brought forth butter
in a lordly dish. She put her hand
to the nail, and her right hand to the
workmen's hammer; and with the
hammer she smote Sisera, she smote
off his head, when she had pierced
and stricken through his temples. At
her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down:
at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he
bowed, there he fell down dead. The
mother of Sisera looked out at a window,
and cried through the lattice,
Why is his chariot so long in coming?
why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
Her wise ladies answered her, yea,
she returned answer to herself, Have
they not sped? have they not divided
the prey; to every man a damsel or
two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours,
a prey of divers colours of needlework,
of divers colours of needlework
on both sides, meet for the necks
of them that take the spoil? So let
all thine enemies perish, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: but
let them that love him be as the sun
when he goeth forth in his might.</p>

<p>And the land had rest forty years.</p>

<small>GIDEON IS SENT TO DELIVER
ISRAEL</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Judges 6</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the children of Israel did
evil in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>:
and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> delivered them
into the hand of Midian seven years.
And the hand of Midian prevailed
against Israel: and because of the Midianites
the children of Israel made
them the dens which are in the mountains,
and caves, and strong holds.
And so it was, when Israel had sown,
that the Midianites came up, and the
Amalekites, and the children of the
east, even they came up against them;
and they encamped against them, and
destroyed the increase of the earth,
till thou come unto Gaza, and left no
sustenance for Israel, neither sheep,
nor ox, nor ass. For they came up
with their cattle and their tents, and
they came as grasshoppers for multitude;
for both they and their camels
were without number: and they entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
into the land to destroy it. And
Israel was greatly impoverished because
of the Midianites; and the children
of Israel cried unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</div>

<p>And it came to pass, when the children
of Israel cried unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> because
of the Midianites, that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
sent a prophet unto the children of
Israel, which said unto them, Thus
saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel, I
brought you up from Egypt, and
brought you forth out of the house of
bondage; and I delivered you out of
the hand of the Egyptians, and out of
the hand of all that oppressed you,
and drave them out from before you,
and gave you their land; and I said
unto you, I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God;
fear not the gods of the Amorites, in
whose land ye dwell: but ye have not
obeyed my voice. And there came an
angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and sat under an
oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained
unto Joash the Abi-ezrite: and
his son Gideon threshed wheat by the
winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared
unto him, and said unto him,
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is with thee, thou mighty
man of valour. And Gideon said unto
him, Oh my Lord, if the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> be with
us, why then is all this befallen us?
and where be all his miracles which
our fathers told us of, saying, Did not
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> bring us up from Egypt? but
now the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath forsaken us, and
delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> looked upon
him, and said, Go in this thy might,
and thou shalt save Israel from the
hand of the Midianites: have not I
sent thee? And he said unto him, Oh
my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel?
behold, my family is poor in
Manasseh, and I am the least in my
father's house. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said
unto him, Surely I will be with thee,
and thou shalt smite the Midianites as
one man. And he said unto him, If
now I have found grace in thy sight,
then shew me a sign that thou talkest
with me. Depart not hence, I pray
thee, until I come unto thee, and bring
forth my present, and set it before
thee. And he said, I will tarry until
thou come again.</p>

<p>And Gideon went in, and made
ready a kid, and unleavened cakes
of an ephah of flour: the flesh he
put in a basket, and he put the broth
in a pot, and brought it out unto
him under the oak, and presented it.
And the angel of God said unto him,
Take the flesh and the unleavened
cakes, and lay them upon this rock,
and pour out the broth. And he did
so. Then the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> put
forth the end of the staff that was in
his hand, and touched the flesh and
the unleavened cakes; and there rose
up fire out of the rock, and consumed
the flesh and the unleavened cakes.
Then the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> departed
out of his sight. And when Gideon
perceived that he was an angel of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>!
for because I have seen an angel of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> face to face. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
said unto him, Peace be unto thee;
fear not: thou shalt not die. Then
Gideon built an altar there unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and called it Jehovah-shalom:
unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of
the Abi-ezrites.</p>

<p>Then all the Midianites and the
Amalekites and the children of the
east were gathered together, and went
over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.
But the Spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came
upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and Abi-ezer was gathered after him.
And he sent messengers throughout
all Manasseh; who also was gathered
after him: and he sent messengers
unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and
unto Naphtali; and they came up to
meet them. And Gideon said unto
God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine
hand, as thou hast said, behold, I will
put a fleece of wool in the floor; and
if the dew be on the fleece only, and
it be dry upon all the earth beside,
then shall I know that thou wilt save
Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.
And it was so: for he rose up early
on the morrow, and thrust the fleece
together, and wringed the dew out of
the fleece, a bowl full of water. And
Gideon said unto God, Let not thine
anger be hot against me, and I will
speak but this once: let me prove, I
pray thee, but this once with the
fleece; let it now be dry only upon the
fleece, and upon all the ground let
there be dew. And God did so that
night: for it was dry upon the fleece
only, and there was dew on all the
ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Judges 7</div>

<p>Then Gideon, and all the people
that were with him, rose up early, and
pitched beside the well of Harod: so
that the host of the Midianites were
on the north side of them, by the hill
of Moreh, in the valley. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Gideon, The people
that are with thee are too many for
me to give the Midianites into their
hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves
against me, saying, Mine own hand
hath saved me. Now therefore go to,
proclaim in the ears of the people,
saying, Whosoever is fearful and
afraid, let him return and depart
early from mount Gilead. And there
returned of the people twenty and two
thousand; and there remained ten
thousand. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto
Gideon, The people are yet too many;
bring them down unto the water, and
I will try them for thee there: and it
shall be, that of whom I say unto
thee, This shall go with thee, the same
shall go with thee; and of whomsoever
I say unto thee, This shall not go
with thee, the same shall not go. So
he brought down the people unto the
water: and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Gideon,
Every one that lappeth of the water
with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him
shalt thou set by himself; likewise
every one that boweth down upon his
knees to drink. And the number of
them that lapped, putting their hand
to their mouth, were three hundred
men: but all the rest of the people
bowed down upon their knees to
drink water. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto
Gideon, By the three hundred men
that lapped will I save you, and deliver
the Midianites into thine hand:
and let all the other people go every
man unto his place. So the people
took victuals in their hand, and their
trumpets: and he sent all the rest of
Israel every man unto his tent, and
retained those three hundred men:
and the host of Midian was beneath
him in the valley.</p>

<p>And it came to pass the same night,
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto him, Arise,
get thee down unto the host; for I
have delivered it into thine hand.
But if thou fear to go down, go thou
with Phurah thy servant down to the
host: and thou shalt hear what they
say; and afterward shall thine hands
be strengthened to go down unto the
host. Then went he down with Phurah
his servant unto the outside of the
armed men that were in the host.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
And the Midianites and the Amalekites
and all the children of the east
lay along in the valley like grasshoppers
for multitude; and their camels
were without number, as the sand by
the sea side for multitude. And when
Gideon was come, behold, there was a
man that told a dream unto his fellow,
and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream,
and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled
into the host of Midian, and came
unto a tent, and smote it that it fell,
and overturned it, that the tent lay
along. And his fellow answered and
said, This is nothing else save the
sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a
man of Israel: for into his hand hath
God delivered Midian, and all the
host.</p>

<p>And it was so, when Gideon heard
the telling of the dream, and the interpretation
thereof, that he worshipped,
and returned into the host
of Israel, and said, Arise; for the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath delivered into your hand
the host of Midian. And he divided
the three hundred men into three
companies, and he put a trumpet in
every man's hand, with empty pitchers,
and lamps within the pitchers.
And he said unto them, Look on me,
and do likewise: and, behold, when I
come to the outside of the camp, it
shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
When I blow with a trumpet, I and
all that are with me, then blow ye the
trumpets also on every side of all
the camp, and say, The sword of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and of Gideon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Judges 8</div>

<p>So Gideon, and the hundred men
that were with him, came unto the outside
of the camp in the beginning of
the middle watch; and they had but
newly set the watch: and they blew
the trumpets, and brake the pitchers
that were in their hands. And the
three companies blew the trumpets,
and brake the pitchers, and held the
lamps in their left hands, and the
trumpets in their right hands to blow
withal: and they cried, The sword of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and of Gideon. And they
stood every man in his place round
about the camp: and all the host ran,
and cried, and fled. And the three
hundred blew the trumpets, and the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> set every man's sword against
his fellow, even throughout all the
host: and the host fled. And the men
of Israel gathered themselves together
out of Naphtali, and out of
Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and
pursued after the Midianites. And
they took two princes of the Midianites,
Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew
Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb
they slew at the winepress of Zeeb,
and pursued Midian, and brought the
heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on
the other side Jordan.</p>

<p>Then the men of Israel said unto
Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou,
and thy son, and thy son's son also:
for thou hast delivered us from the
hand of Midian. And Gideon said
unto them, I will not rule over you,
neither shall my son rule over you:
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall rule over you.</p>

<p>And Gideon the son of Joash died
in a good old age, and was buried in
the sepulchre of Joash his father, in
Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.</p>

<p>And the children of Israel remembered
not the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> their God, who
had delivered them out of the hands
of all their enemies on every side:
neither shewed they kindness to the
house of Gideon, according to all the
goodness which he had shewed unto
Israel.</p>

<small>JEPHTHAH AND HIS DAUGHTER</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Judges 10</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the children of Israel did
evil again in the sight of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and served Baalim, and
Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and
the gods of Zidon, and the gods of
Moab, and the gods of the children of
Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines,
and forsook the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and served
not him. And the anger of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
was hot against Israel, and he sold
them into the hands of the Philistines,
and into the hands of the children of
Ammon. Moreover the children of
Ammon passed over Jordan to fight
also against Judah, and against Benjamin,
and against the house of
Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
And the children of Israel
cried unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, saying, We have
sinned against thee, both because we
have forsaken our God, and also
served Baalim. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said
unto the children of Israel, Did not I
deliver you from the Egyptians, and
from the Amorites, from the children
of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites,
and the Maonites, did oppress
you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered
you out of their hand. Yet ye
have forsaken me, and served other
gods: wherefore I will deliver you no
more. Go and cry unto the gods
which ye have chosen; let them deliver
you in the time of your tribulation.</div>

<p>And the children of Israel said unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, We have sinned: do thou
unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto
thee; deliver us only, we pray thee,
this day. And they put away the
strange gods from among them, and
served the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and his soul was
grieved for the misery of Israel.
Then the children of Ammon were
gathered together, and encamped in
Gilead. And the children of Israel
assembled themselves together, and
encamped in Mizpeh. And the people
and princes of Gilead said one to another,
What man is he that will begin
to fight against the children of Ammon?
he shall be head over all the inhabitants
of Gilead.</p>

<p>Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a
mighty man of valour. And it was so,
that when the children of Ammon
made war against Israel, the elders of
Gilead said unto Jephthah, Come, and
be our captain, that we may fight with
the children of Ammon. And Jephthah
said unto the elders of Gilead,
If ye bring me home again to fight
against the children of Ammon, and
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> deliver them before me, shall
I be your head? And the elders of
Gilead said unto Jephthah, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
be witness between us, if we do not
so according to thy words. Then
Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead,
and the people made him head
and captain over them: and Jephthah
uttered all his words before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
in Mizpeh.</p>

<p>Then the Spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came
upon Jephthah.</p>

<p>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said, If thou shalt without
fail deliver the children of Ammon
into mine hands, then it shall be,
that whatsoever cometh forth of the
doors of my house to meet me, when I
return in peace from the children of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Ammon, shall surely be the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>,
and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</p>

<p>So Jephthah passed over unto the
children of Ammon to fight against
them; and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> delivered them
into his hands. And he smote them
from Aroer, even till thou come to
Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto
the plain of the vineyards, with a very
great slaughter. Thus the children
of Ammon were subdued before the
children of Israel. And Jephthah
came to Mizpeh unto his house, and,
behold, his daughter came out to meet
him with timbrels and with dances:
and she was his only child; beside her
he had neither son nor daughter. And
it came to pass, when he saw her, that
he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my
daughter! thou hast brought me very
low, and thou art one of them that
trouble me: for I have opened my
mouth unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and I cannot go
back. And she said unto him, My father,
if thou hast opened thy mouth
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, do to me according to
that which hath proceeded out of thy
mouth; forasmuch as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath
taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies,
even of the children of Ammon.
And she said unto her father, Let this
thing be done for me: let me alone
two months, that I may go up and
down upon the mountains, and bewail
my virginity, I and my fellows. And
he said, Go. And he sent her away
for two months: and she went with
her companions, and bewailed her virginity
upon the mountains. And it
came to pass at the end of two months,
that she returned unto her father, who
did with her according to his vow
which he had vowed. And it was a
custom in Israel, that the daughters
of Israel went yearly to lament the
daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite
four days in a year.</p>

<p>And Jephthah judged Israel six
years, and he died. And after him
were three other judges in Israel.</p>

<small>SAMSON</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Judges 13</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the children of Israel did
evil again in the sight of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> delivered
them into the hand of the Philistines
forty years. And there was a certain
man of Zorah, of the family
of the Danites, whose name was
Manoah; and his wife had no children.
And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
appeared unto the woman, and said
unto her, Behold, thou shalt bear a
son. Now therefore beware, I pray
thee, and drink not wine nor strong
drink, and eat not any unclean thing:
for the child shall be a Nazarite unto
God from his birth: and he shall begin
to deliver Israel out of the hand of
the Philistines.</div>

<p>And the woman bare a son, and
called his name Samson: and the child
grew, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> blessed him. And
the Spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> began to move
him at times in the camp of Dan between
Zorah and Eshtaol. And Samson
went down to Timnath, and saw
a woman in Timnath of the daughters
of the Philistines. And he came up,
and told his father and his mother,
and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath
of the daughters of the Philistines:
now therefore get her for me
to wife. Then his father and his mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
said unto him, Is there never a
woman among the daughters of thy
brethren, or among all my people, that
thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised
Philistines? And Samson
said unto his father, Get her for me;
for she pleaseth me well. But his father
and his mother knew not that it
was of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that he sought an occasion
against the Philistines: for at
that time the Philistines had dominion
over Israel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Judges 14</div>

<p>Then went Samson down, and his
father and his mother, to Timnath,
and came to the vineyards of Timnath:
and, behold, a young lion roared
against him. And the Spirit of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> came mightily upon him, and he
rent him as he would have rent a kid,
and he had nothing in his hand: but
he told not his father or his mother
what he had done. And he went
down, and talked with the woman;
and she pleased Samson well. And
after a time he returned to take her,
and he turned aside to see the carcase
of the lion: and, behold, there was a
swarm of bees and honey in the carcase
of the lion. And he took thereof
in his hands, and went on eating, and
came to his father and mother, and
he gave them, and they did eat: but
he told not them that he had taken the
honey out of the carcase of the lion.
So his father went down unto the
woman: and Samson made there a
feast; for so used the young men to
do. And it came to pass, when they
saw him, that they brought thirty
companions to be with him. And
Samson said unto them, I will now
put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can
certainly declare it me within the
seven days of the feast, and find it
out, then I will give you thirty sheets
and thirty change of garments: but
if ye cannot declare it me, then shall
ye give me thirty sheets and thirty
change of garments. And they said
unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that
we may hear it. And he said unto
them, Out of the eater came forth
meat, and out of the strong came forth
sweetness. And they could not in
three days expound the riddle. And
it came to pass on the seventh day,
that they said unto Samson's wife,
Entice thy husband, that he may declare
unto us the riddle, lest we burn
thee and thy father's house with fire:
have ye called us to take that we
have? is it not so? And Samson's
wife wept before him, and said, Thou
dost but hate me, and lovest me not:
thou hast put forth a riddle unto the
children of my people, and hast not
told it me. And he said unto her, Behold,
I have not told it my father nor
my mother, and shall I tell it thee?
And she wept before him the seven
days, while their feast lasted: and it
came to pass on the seventh day, that
he told her, because she lay sore upon
him: and she told the riddle to the
children of her people. And the men
of the city said unto him on the seventh
day before the sun went down,
What is sweeter than honey? and
what is stronger than a lion? And he
said unto them, If ye had not plowed
with my heifer, ye had not found out
my riddle.</p>

<p>And the Spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came
upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon,
and slew thirty men of them,
and took their spoil, and gave change
of garments unto them which expounded
the riddle. And his anger
was kindled, and he went up to his
father's house. But Samson's wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
was given to his companion, whom he
had used as his friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Judges 15</div>

<p>But it came to pass within a while
after, in the time of wheat harvest,
that Samson visited his wife with a
kid; and he said, I will go in to my
wife into the chamber. But her father
would not suffer him to go in.</p>

<p>And her father said, I verily
thought that thou hadst utterly hated
her; therefore I gave her to thy companion:
is not her younger sister
fairer than she? take her, I pray thee,
instead of her. And Samson said
concerning them, Now shall I be more
blameless than the Philistines, though
I do them a displeasure. And Samson
went and caught three hundred
foxes, and took firebrands, and turned
tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the
midst between two tails. And when
he had set the brands on fire, he let
them go into the standing corn of the
Philistines, and burnt up both the
shocks, and also the standing corn,
with the vineyards and olives. Then
the Philistines said, Who hath done
this? And they answered, Samson,
the son in law of the Timnite, because
he had taken his wife, and given her
to his companion. And the Philistines
came up, and burnt her and her
father with fire. And Samson said
unto them, Though ye have done this,
yet will I be avenged of you, and after
that I will cease. And he smote them
hip and thigh with a great slaughter:
and he went down and dwelt in the
top of the rock Etam.</p>

<p>Then the Philistines went up, and
pitched in Judah, and spread themselves
in Lehi. And the men of Judah
said, Why are ye come up against
us? And they answered, To bind
Samson are we come up, to do to him
as he hath done to us. Then three
thousand men of Judah went to the
top of the rock Etam, and said to
Samson, Knowest thou not that the
Philistines are rulers over us? what
is this that thou hast done unto us?
And he said unto them, As they did
unto me, so have I done unto them.
And they said unto him, We are come
down to bind thee, that we may deliver
thee into the hand of the Philistines.
And Samson said unto them,
Swear unto me, that ye will not fall
upon me yourselves. And they spake
unto him, saying, No; but we will bind
thee fast, and deliver thee into their
hand: but surely we will not kill thee.
And they bound him with two new
cords, and brought him up from the
rock. And when he came unto Lehi,
the Philistines shouted against him:
and the Spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came
mightily upon him, and the cords that
were upon his arms became as flax
that was burnt with fire, and his bands
loosed from off his hands. And he
found a new jawbone of an ass, and
put forth his hand, and took it, and
slew a thousand men therewith. And
Samson said, With the jawbone of an
ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw
of an ass have I slain a thousand men.
And it came to pass, when he had
made an end of speaking, that he cast
away the jawbone out of his hand, and
called that place Ramath-lehi. And
he was sore athirst, and called on the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said, Thou hast given this
great deliverance into the hand of thy
servant: and now shall I die for thirst,
and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
But God clave an hollow
place that was in the jaw, and there
came water thereout; and when he
had drunk, his spirit came again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
he revived. And he judged Israel in
the days of the Philistines twenty
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Judges 16</div>

<p>Then went Samson to Gaza. And
it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson
is come hither. And they compassed
him in, and laid wait for him
all night in the gate of the city, and
were quiet all the night, saying, In
the morning, when it is day, we shall
kill him. And Samson lay till midnight,
and arose at midnight, and took
the doors of the gate of the city, and
the two posts, and went away with
them, bar and all, and put them upon
his shoulders, and carried them up to
the top of an hill that is before Hebron.
And it came to pass afterward,
that he loved a woman in the valley of
Sorek, whose name was Delilah. And
the lords of the Philistines came up
unto her, and said unto her, Entice
him, and see wherein his great
strength lieth, and by what means we
may prevail against him, that we may
bind him to afflict him: and we will
give thee every one of us eleven hundred
pieces of silver. And Delilah
said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee,
wherein thy great strength lieth, and
wherewith thou mightest be bound to
afflict thee. And Samson said unto
her, If they bind me with seven green
withs that were never dried, then
shall I be weak, and be as another
man. Then the lords of the Philistines
brought up to her seven green
withs which had not been dried, and
she bound him with them. Now there
were men lying in wait, abiding with
her in the chamber. And she said
unto him, The Philistines be upon
thee, Samson. And he brake the
withs, as a thread of tow is broken
when it toucheth the fire. So his
strength was not known. And Delilah
said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast
mocked me, and told me lies: now
tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou
mightest be bound. And he said unto
her, If they bind me fast with new
ropes that never were occupied, then
shall I be weak, and be as another
man. Delilah therefore took new
ropes, and bound him therewith, and
said unto him, The Philistines be
upon thee, Samson. And there were
liers in wait abiding in the chamber.
And he brake them from off his arms
like a thread.</p>

<p>And Delilah said unto Samson,
Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and
told me lies: tell me wherewith thou
mightest be bound. And he said unto
her, If thou weavest the seven locks
of my head with the web. And she
fastened it with the pin, and said unto
him, The Philistines be upon thee,
Samson. And he awaked out of his
sleep, and went away with the pin of
the beam, and with the web. And she
said unto him, How canst thou say, I
love thee, when thine heart is not with
me? thou hast mocked me these three
times, and hast not told me wherein
thy great strength lieth. And it came
to pass, when she pressed him daily
with her words, and urged him, so
that his soul was vexed unto death;
that he told her all his heart, and
said unto her, There hath not come
a razor upon mine head; for I have
been a Nazarite unto God from my
birth: if I be shaven, then my
strength will go from me, and I shall
become weak, and be like any other
man. And when Delilah saw that he
had told her all his heart, she sent and
called for the lords of the Philistines,
saying, Come up this once, for he hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
shewed me all his heart. Then the
lords of the Philistines came up unto
her, and brought money in their hand.
And she made him sleep upon her
knees; and she called for a man, and
she caused him to shave off the seven
locks of his head; and she began to
afflict him, and his strength went from
him. And she said, The Philistines
be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke
out of his sleep, and said, I will go out
as at other times before, and shake
myself. And he wist not that the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> was departed from him.</p>

<p>But the Philistines took him, and
put out his eyes, and brought him
down to Gaza, and bound him with
fetters of brass; and he did grind in
the prison house. Howbeit the hair
of his head began to grow again after
he was shaven. Then the lords of the
Philistines gathered them together
for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon
their god, and to rejoice: for they
said, Our god hath delivered Samson
our enemy into our hand. And when
the people saw him, they praised their
god: for they said, Our god hath delivered
into our hands our enemy, and
the destroyer of our country, which
slew many of us. And it came to pass,
when their hearts were merry, that
they said, Call for Samson, that he
may make us sport. And they called
for Samson out of the prison house;
and he made them sport: and they
set him between the pillars. And
Samson said unto the lad that held
him by the hand, Suffer me that I may
feel the pillars whereupon the house
standeth, that I may lean upon them.
Now the house was full of men and
women; and all the lords of the Philistines
were there; and there were upon
the roof about three thousand men
and women, that beheld while Samson
made sport. And Samson called
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said, O Lord
<span class="smcap">God</span>, remember me, I pray thee, and
strengthen me, I pray thee, only this
once, O God, that I may be at once
avenged of the Philistines for my two
eyes. And Samson took hold of the
two middle pillars upon which the
house stood, and on which it was
borne up, of the one with his right
hand, and of the other with his left.
And Samson said, Let me die with
the Philistines. And he bowed himself
with all his might; and the house
fell upon the lords, and upon all the
people that were therein. So the dead
which he slew at his death were more
than they which he slew in his life.
Then his brethren and all the house
of his father came down, and took
him, and brought him up, and buried
him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the
buryingplace of Manoah his father.</p>

<small>THE STORY OF RUTH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Ruth 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW it came to pass in the days
when the judges ruled, that
there was a famine in the
land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah
went to sojourn in the
country of Moab, he, and his wife, and
his two sons. And the name of the
man was Elimelech, and the name of
his wife Naomi, and the name of his
two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites
of Beth-lehem-judah. And
they came into the country of Moab,
and continued there. And Elimelech
Naomi's husband died; and she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
left, and her two sons. And they took
them wives of the women of Moab;
the name of the one was Orpah, and
the name of the other Ruth: and they
dwelled there about ten years. And
Mahlon and Chilion died also both of
them; and the woman was left of her
two sons and her husband.</div>

<p>Then she arose with her daughters
in law, that she might return from
the country of Moab: for she had
heard in the country of Moab how
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had visited his people
in giving them bread. Wherefore she
went forth out of the place where she
was, and her two daughters in law
with her; and they went on the way
to return unto the land of Judah.
And Naomi said unto her two daughters
in law, Go, return each to her
mother's house: the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> deal kindly
with you, as ye have dealt with the
dead, and with me. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> grant
you that ye may find rest, each of you
in the house of her husband. Then
she kissed them; and they lifted up
their voice, and wept. And they said
unto her, Surely we will return with
thee unto thy people. And Naomi
said, Turn again, my daughters: why
will ye go with me? nay, my daughters;
for it grieveth me much for your
sakes that the hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is
gone out against me.</p>

<p>And they lifted up their voice, and
wept again: and Orpah kissed her
mother in law; but Ruth clave unto
her. And she said, Behold, thy sister
in law is gone back unto her people,
and unto her gods: return thou after
thy sister in law. And Ruth said, Intreat
me not to leave thee, or to return
from following after thee: for
whither thou goest, I will go; and
where thou lodgest, I will lodge:
thy people shall be my people, and
thy God my God: where thou diest,
will I die, and there will I be buried:
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> do so to me, and more also,
if ought but death part thee and me.
When she saw that she was stedfastly
minded to go with her, then she left
speaking unto her. So they two went
until they came to Beth-lehem.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when they
were come to Beth-lehem, that all the
city was moved about them, and they
said, Is this Naomi? And she said
unto them, Call me not Naomi, call
me Mara: for the Almighty hath
dealt very bitterly with me. I went
out full, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath brought
me home again empty: why then call
ye me Naomi, seeing the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath
testified against me, and the Almighty
hath afflicted me? So Naomi
returned, and Ruth the Moabitess,
her daughter in law, with her, which
returned out of the country of Moab:
and they came to Beth-lehem in the
beginning of barley harvest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ruth 2</div>

<p>And Naomi had a kinsman of her
husband's, a mighty man of wealth,
of the family of Elimelech; and his
name was Boaz. And Ruth the Moabitess
said unto Naomi, Let me now
go to the field, and glean ears of corn
after him in whose sight I shall find
grace. And she said unto her, Go,
my daughter. And she went, and
came, and gleaned in the field after
the reapers: and her hap was to
light on a part of the field belonging
unto Boaz, who was of the kindred
of Elimelech. And, behold, Boaz
came from Beth-lehem, and said unto
the reapers, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> be with you.
And they answered him, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
bless thee. Then said Boaz unto his
servant that was set over the reapers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Whose damsel is this? And the servant
that was set over the reapers
answered and said, It is the Moabitish
damsel that came back with Naomi
out of the country of Moab:
and she said, I pray you, let me
glean and gather after the reapers
among the sheaves: so she came, and
hath continued even from the morning
until now, that she tarried a little
in the house.</p>

<p>Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest
thou not, my daughter? Go not to
glean in another field, neither go
from hence, but abide here fast by
my maidens: let thine eyes be on
the field that they do reap, and go
thou after them: have I not charged
the young men that they shall not
touch thee? and when thou art athirst,
go unto the vessels, and drink of that
which the young men have drawn.
Then she fell on her face, and bowed
herself to the ground, and said unto
him, Why have I found grace in
thine eyes, that thou shouldest take
knowledge of me, seeing I am a
stranger? And Boaz answered and
said unto her, It hath fully been
shewed me, all that thou hast done
unto thy mother in law since the
death of thine husband: and how thou
hast left thy father and thy mother,
and the land of thy nativity, and art
come unto a people which thou knewest
not heretofore. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> recompense
thy work, and a full reward be
given thee of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel,
under whose wings thou art come
to trust. Then she said, Let me find
favour in thy sight, my lord; for
that thou hast comforted me, and for
that thou hast spoken friendly unto
thine handmaid, though I be not like
unto one of thine handmaidens. And
Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come
thou hither, and eat of the bread, and
dip thy morsel in the vinegar.</p>

<p>And she sat beside the reapers: and
he reached her parched corn, and she
did eat, and was sufficed, and left.
And when she was risen up to glean,
Boaz commanded his young men,
saying, Let her glean even among
the sheaves, and reproach her not:
and let fall also some of the handfuls
of purpose for her, and leave them,
that she may glean them, and rebuke
her not. So she gleaned in the field
until even, and beat out that she had
gleaned: and it was about an ephah
of barley.</p>

<p>And she took it up, and went into
the city: and her mother in law saw
what she had gleaned: and she
brought forth, and gave to her that
she had reserved after she was sufficed.
And her mother in law said
unto her, Where hast thou gleaned
to day? and where wroughtest thou?
blessed be he that did take knowledge
of thee. And she shewed her mother
in law with whom she had wrought,
and said, The man's name with whom
I wrought to day is Boaz. And Naomi
said unto her daughter in law,
Blessed be he of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, who hath
not left off his kindness to the living
and to the dead. And Naomi said
unto her, The man is near of kin unto
us, one of our next kinsmen. And
Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto
me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my
young men, until they have ended all
my harvest. And Naomi said unto
Ruth her daughter in law, It is good,
my daughter, that thou go out with
his maidens, that they meet thee not
in any other field. So she kept fast
by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the end of barley harvest and of wheat
harvest; and dwelt with her mother
in law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ruth 3</div>

<p>Then Naomi her mother in law said
unto her, My daughter, shall I not
seek rest for thee, that it may be well
with thee? And now is not Boaz of
our kindred, with whose maidens thou
wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley
to night in the threshingfloor. Wash
thyself therefore, and anoint thee,
and put thy raiment upon thee, and
get thee down to the floor: but make
not thyself known unto the man, until
he shall have done eating and drinking.
And it shall be, when he lieth
down, that thou shalt mark the place
where he shall lie, and thou shalt go
in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee
down; and he will tell thee what thou
shalt do. And she said unto her, All
that thou sayest unto me I will do.</p>

<p>And she went down unto the floor,
and did according to all that her mother
in law bade her. And when Boaz
had eaten and drunk, and his heart
was merry, he went to lie down at the
end of the heap of corn: and she came
softly, and uncovered his feet, and
laid her down. And it came to pass
at midnight, that the man was afraid,
and turned himself: and, behold, a
woman lay at his feet. And he said,
Who art thou? And she answered, I
am Ruth thine handmaid: spread
therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid;
for thou art a near kinsman.
And he said, Blessed be thou of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, my daughter: for thou hast
shewed more kindness in the latter
end than at the beginning, inasmuch
as thou followedst not young men,
whether poor or rich. And now, my
daughter, fear not; I will do to thee
all that thou requirest: for all the city
of my people doth know that thou art
a virtuous woman. And now it is true
that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit
there is a kinsman nearer than I.
Tarry this night, and it shall be in
the morning, that if he will perform
unto thee the part of a kinsman, well;
let him do the kinsman's part: but if
he will not do the part of a kinsman to
thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman
to thee, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> liveth: lie
down until the morning.</p>

<p>And she lay at his feet until the
morning: and she rose up before one
could know another. And he said, Let
it not be known that a woman came
into the floor. Also he said, Bring
the vail that thou hast upon thee, and
hold it. And when she held it, he
measured six measures of barley, and
laid it on her: and she went into the
city. And when she came to her mother
in law, she said, Who art thou,
my daughter? And she told her all
that the man had done to her. And
she said, These six measures of barley
gave he me; for he said to me, Go not
empty unto thy mother in law. Then
said she, Sit still, my daughter, until
thou know how the matter will fall:
for the man will not be in rest, until
he have finished the thing this day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ruth 4</div>

<p>Then went Boaz up to the gate, and
sat him down there: and, behold, the
kinsman of whom Boaz spake came
by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a
one! turn aside, sit down here. And
he turned aside, and sat down. And
he took ten men of the elders of the
city, and said, Sit ye down here. And
they sat down. And he said unto the
kinsman, Naomi, that is come again
out of the country of Moab, selleth a
parcel of land, which was our brother
Elimelech's: and I thought to advertise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants,
and before the elders of my
people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem
it: but if thou wilt not redeem
it, then tell me, that I may know: for
there is none to redeem it beside thee:
and I am after thee. And the kinsman
said, I cannot redeem it for myself,
lest I mar mine own inheritance:
redeem thou my right to thyself; for
I cannot redeem it.</p>

<p>And Boaz said unto the elders, and
unto all the people, Ye are witnesses
this day, that I have bought all that
was Elimelech's, and all that was
Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand
of Naomi. Moreover Ruth the Moabitess,
the wife of Mahlon, have I
purchased to be my wife, to raise up
the name of the dead upon his inheritance,
that the name of the dead be
not cut off from among his brethren,
and from the gate of his place: ye are
witnesses this day. And all the people
that were in the gate, and the elders,
said, We are witnesses.</p>

<p>So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his
wife: and she bare a son. And the
women said unto Naomi, Blessed be
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, which hath not left thee this
day without a kinsman, that his name
may be famous in Israel. And he
shall be unto thee a restorer of thy
life, and a nourisher of thine old age:
for thy daughter in law, which loveth
thee, which is better to thee than
seven sons, hath born him. And Naomi
took the child, and laid it in her
bosom, and became nurse unto it.
And the women her neighbours gave
it a name, saying, There is a son born
to Naomi; and they called his name
Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the
father of David.</p>

<small>SAMUEL</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-n.jpg" width="150" height="176" alt="N" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">NOW there was a
certain man of
mount Ephraim,
and his name was
Elkanah: and he
had two wives;
the name of the
one was Hannah,
and the name of
the other Peninnah: and Peninnah
had children, but Hannah had no children.
And this man went up out of
his city yearly to worship and to
sacrifice unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts in
Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,
Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, were there. And when the
time was that Elkanah offered, he
gave to Peninnah his wife, and to
all her sons and her daughters, portions:
but unto Hannah he gave a
worthy portion; for he loved Hannah.
And her adversary also provoked
her sore; therefore she wept,
and did not eat. Then said Elkanah
her husband to her, Hannah, why
weepest thou? and why eatest thou
not? and why is thy heart grieved?
am not I better to thee than ten sons?</div>

<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 2</div>

<p>So Hannah rose up after they had
eaten in Shiloh, and after they had
drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon
a seat by a post of the temple of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And she was in bitterness of
soul, and prayed unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
wept sore. And she vowed a vow,
and said, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts, if thou wilt
indeed look on the affliction of thine
handmaid, and remember me, and not
forget thine handmaid, but wilt give
unto thine handmaid a man child, then
I will give him unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> all the
days of his life, and there shall no
razor come upon his head. And it
came to pass, as she continued praying
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that Eli marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
her mouth. Now Hannah, she spake
in her heart; only her lips moved, but
her voice was not heard: therefore
Eli thought she had been drunken.
And Eli said unto her, How long wilt
thou be drunken? put away thy wine
from thee. And Hannah answered
and said, No, my lord, I am a woman
of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk
neither wine nor strong drink, but
have poured out my soul before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Count not thine handmaid for
a daughter of Belial: for out of the
abundance of my complaint and grief
have I spoken hitherto. Then Eli answered
and said, Go in peace: and the
God of Israel grant thee thy petition
that thou hast asked of him. And she
said, Let thine handmaid find grace
in thy sight. So the woman went her
way, and did eat, and her countenance
was no more sad. And they rose up
in the morning early, and worshipped
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and returned, and
came to their house to Ramah; and
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> remembered her. Wherefore
it came to pass, that she bare a
son, and called his name Samuel, saying,
Because I have asked him of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the man Elkanah, and all
his house, went up to offer unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
But Hannah went not up; for she said
unto her husband, I will not go up
until the child be weaned, and then I
will bring him, that he may appear
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and there abide for
ever. And Elkanah her husband said
unto her, Do what seemeth thee good;
tarry until thou have weaned him;
only the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> establish his word. So
the woman abode, and gave her son
suck until she weaned him.</p>

<div class="caption">THE INFANT SAMUEL AT PRAYER,<br />

<small>BY SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS</small><br />

<span class='location'>IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY, LONDON</span></div>
</div>

<p>And when she had weaned him, she
took him up with her, with three bullocks,
and one ephah of flour, and a
bottle of wine, and brought him unto
the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in Shiloh: and
the child was young. And they slew
a bullock, and brought the child to
Eli. And she said, Oh my lord, as
thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman
that stood by thee here, praying
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. For this child I
prayed; and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath given me
my petition which I asked of him:
therefore also I have lent him to the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>; as long as he liveth he shall be
lent to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And he worshipped
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> there. And Elkanah went
to Ramah to his house.</p>

<p>Now the sons of Eli were sons
of Belial; they knew not the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
But Samuel ministered before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, being a child, girded with a
linen ephod. Moreover his mother
made him a little coat, and brought it
to him from year to year, when she
came up with her husband to offer the
yearly sacrifice.</p>

<p>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his
wife. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> visited Hannah,
so that she bare three sons and two
daughters. And the child Samuel
grew on, and was in favour both with
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and also with men. And the
child Samuel ministered unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> before Eli. And the word of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was precious in those days;
there was no open vision.</p>

<p>And it came to pass at that time,
when Eli was laid down in his place,
and his eyes began to wax dim, that
he could not see; and ere the lamp of
God went out in the temple of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, where the ark of God was, and
Samuel was laid down to sleep; that
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> called Samuel: and he answered,
Here am I. And he ran unto
Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
calledst me. And he said, I called
not; lie down again. And he went
and lay down. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> called
yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose
and went to Eli, and said, Here am I;
for thou didst call me. And he answered,
I called not, my son; lie down
again. Now Samuel did not yet know
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, neither was the word of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> yet revealed unto him. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> called Samuel again the third
time. And he arose and went to Eli,
and said, Here am I; for thou didst
call me. And Eli perceived that the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> had called the child. Therefore
Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down:
and it shall be, if he call thee, that
thou shalt say, Speak, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; for thy
servant heareth. So Samuel went
and lay down in his place. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> came, and stood, and called as
at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then
Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant
heareth.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said to Samuel, Behold,
I will do a thing in Israel, at
which both the ears of every one that
heareth it shall tingle. In that day I
will perform against Eli all things
which I have spoken concerning his
house. For I have told him that I
will judge his house for ever for the
iniquity which he knoweth; because
his sons made themselves vile, and he
restrained them not. And Samuel lay
until the morning, and opened the
doors of the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.
Then Eli called Samuel, and said,
Samuel, my son. And he answered,
Here am I. And he said, What is the
thing that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath said unto
thee? I pray thee hide it not from
me: God do so to thee, and more also,
if thou hide any thing from me of all
the things that he said unto thee. And
Samuel told him every whit, and hid
nothing from him. And he said, It
is the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: let him do what seemeth
him good.</p>

<p>And Samuel grew, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
was with him, and did let none of his
words fall to the ground. And all Israel
from Dan even to Beer-sheba
knew that Samuel was established to
be a prophet of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared again in Shiloh: for
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> revealed himself to Samuel
in Shiloh by the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<small>THE PHILISTINES TAKE
THE ARK</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 4</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the word of Samuel came to
all Israel. Now Israel went
out against the Philistines to
battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer:
and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
And the Philistines fought, and Israel
was smitten, and they fled every man
into his tent: and there was a very
great slaughter; for there fell of Israel
thirty thousand footmen. And
the ark of God was taken; and the
two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas,
were slain. And there ran a man
of Benjamin out of the army, and
came to Shiloh the same day with his
clothes rent, and with earth upon his
head. And when he came, lo, Eli sat
upon a seat by the wayside watching:
for his heart trembled for the ark of
God. And when the man came into
the city, and told it, all the city cried
out. And when Eli heard the noise
of the crying, he said, What meaneth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the noise of this tumult? And the
man came in hastily, and told Eli.
Now Eli was ninety and eight years
old; and his eyes were dim, that he
could not see. And the man said unto
Eli, I am he that came out of the
army, and I fled to day out of the
army. And he said, What is there
done, my son? And the messenger
answered and said, Israel is fled before
the Philistines, and there hath
been also a great slaughter among the
people, and thy two sons also, Hophni
and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark
of God is taken. And it came to pass,
when he made mention of the ark of
God, that he fell from off the seat
backward by the side of the gate, and
his neck brake, and he died: for he
was an old man, and heavy. And he
had judged Israel forty years.</div>

<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 5</div>

<p>And the Philistines took the ark of
God, and brought it from Eben-ezer
unto Ashdod. When the Philistines
took the ark of God, they brought it
into the house of Dagon, and set it by
Dagon. And when they of Ashdod
arose early on the morrow, behold,
Dagon was fallen upon his face to the
earth before the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
they took Dagon, and set him in his
place again. And when they arose
early on the morrow morning, behold,
Dagon was fallen upon his face to the
ground before the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>;
and the head of Dagon and both the
palms of his hands were cut off upon
the threshold; only the stump of Dagon
was left to him. Therefore neither
the priests of Dagon, nor any that
come into Dagon's house, tread on the
threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto
this day. But the hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
was heavy upon them of Ashdod.
And when the men of Ashdod saw
that it was so, they said, The ark of
the God of Israel shall not abide with
us: for his hand is sore upon us, and
upon Dagon our god. They sent
therefore and gathered all the lords
of the Philistines unto them, and said,
What shall we do with the ark of the
God of Israel? And they answered,
Let the ark of the God of Israel be
carried about unto Gath. And they
carried the ark of the God of Israel
about thither. And it was so, that,
after they had carried it about, the
hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was against the city
with a very great destruction. Therefore
they sent the ark of God to
Ekron. And it came to pass, as the
ark of God came to Ekron, that the
Ekronites cried out, saying, They
have brought about the ark of the
God of Israel to us, to slay us and our
people. So they sent and gathered
together all the lords of the Philistines,
and said, Send away the ark
of the God of Israel, and let it go
again to his own place, that it slay
us not, and our people: for there was
a deadly destruction throughout all
the city; the hand of God was very
heavy there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 7</div>

<p>And the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was in
the country of the Philistines seven
months. And the Philistines called
for the priests and the diviners, saying,
What shall we do to the ark of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? tell us wherewith we shall
send it to his place. And they said,
If ye send away the ark of the God of
Israel, send it not empty; but in any
wise return him a trespass offering:
then ye shall be healed, and it shall
be known to you why his hand is not
removed from you. Now therefore
make a new cart, and take two milch
kine, on which there hath come no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
yoke, and tie the kine to the cart,
and bring their calves home from
them: and take the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and lay it upon the cart; and put the
jewels of gold, which ye return him
for a trespass offering, in a coffer
by the side thereof; and send it away,
that it may go. And see, if it goeth
up by the way of his own coast to
Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us
this great evil: but if not, then we
shall know that it is not his hand
that smote us; it was a chance that
happened to us. And the men did
so. And the kine took the straight
way to the way of Beth-shemesh, and
went along the highway, lowing as
they went, and turned not aside to
the right hand or to the left; and the
lords of the Philistines went after
them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.
And they of Beth-shemesh
were reaping their wheat harvest in
the valley: and they lifted up their
eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced
to see it. And the cart came into the
field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and
stood there, where there was a great
stone: and they clave the wood of the
cart, and offered the kine a burnt
offering unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the Levites
took down the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and the coffer that was with it, wherein
the jewels of gold were, and put
them on the great stone: and the men
of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings
and sacrificed sacrifices the
same day unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And when
the five lords of the Philistines had
seen it, they returned to Ekron the
same day. And the men of Kirjath-jearim
came, and fetched up the ark
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and brought it into the
house of Abinadab in the hill, and
sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the
ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And it came to
pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim,
that the time was long; for
it was twenty years: and all the house
of Israel lamented after the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_78" id="CHAPTER_78">CHAPTER 78</a><br />

<small>THE ISRAELITES DESIRE A KING</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND Samuel judged Israel all
the days of his life. And he
went from year to year in
circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and
Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those
places. And his return was to Ramah;
for there was his house; and
there he judged Israel; and there he
built an altar unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</div>

<p>And it came to pass, when Samuel
was old, that he made his sons
judges over Israel. Now the name
of his firstborn was Joel; and the
name of his second, Abiah: they
were judges in Beer-sheba. And his
sons walked not in his ways, but
turned aside after lucre, and took
bribes, and perverted judgment.
Then all the elders of Israel gathered
themselves together, and came to
Samuel unto Ramah, and said unto
him, Behold, thou art old, and thy
sons walk not in thy ways: now make
us a king to judge us like all the
nations. But the thing displeased
Samuel, when they said, Give us a
king to judge us. And Samuel
prayed unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the Lord
said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the
voice of the people in all that they say
unto thee: for they have not rejected
thee, but they have rejected me, that
I should not reign over them. According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to all the works which they
have done since the day that I
brought them up out of Egypt even
unto this day, wherewith they have
forsaken me, and served other gods,
so do they also unto thee. Now
therefore hearken unto their voice:
howbeit yet protest solemnly unto
them, and shew them the manner of
the king that shall reign over them.
And Samuel told all the words of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> unto the people that asked of
him a king. And he said, This will
be the manner of the king that shall
reign over you: He will take your
sons, and appoint them for himself,
for his chariots, and to be his horsemen;
and some shall run before his
chariots. And he will take your
daughters to be confectionaries, and
to be cooks, and to be bakers. And
he will take your fields, and your
vineyards, and your oliveyards,
even the best of them, and give
them to his servants. And he will
take the tenth of your seed, and
of your vineyards, and give to his
officers, and to his servants. And
he will take your menservants, and
your maidservants, and your goodliest
young men, and your asses, and
put them to his work. He will take
the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall
be his servants. And ye shall cry out
in that day because of your king
which ye shall have chosen you; and
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will not hear you in that
day.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the people refused to
obey the voice of Samuel; and they
said, Nay; but we will have a king
over us; that we also may be like all
the nations; and that our king may
judge us, and go out before us, and
fight our battles. And Samuel heard
all the words of the people, and he
rehearsed them in the ears of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said to Samuel,
Hearken unto their voice, and make
them a king. And Samuel said unto
the men of Israel, Go ye every man
unto his city.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_79" id="CHAPTER_79">CHAPTER 79</a><br />

<small>SAUL ANOINTED KING</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 9</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW there was a man of Benjamin,
whose name was Kish,
a Benjamite, a mighty man
of power. And he had a son, whose
name was Saul, a choice young man,
and a goodly: and there was not
among the children of Israel a goodlier
person than he: from his shoulders
and upward he was higher than
any of the people. And the asses of
Kish Saul's father were lost. And
Kish said to Saul his son, Take now
one of the servants with thee, and
arise, go seek the asses. And he
passed through mount Ephraim, and
passed through the land of Shalisha,
but they found them not: then they
passed through the land of Shalim,
and there they were not: and he
passed through the land of the Benjamites,
but they found them not.
And when they were come to the
land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant
that was with him, Come, and
let us return; lest my father leave
caring for the asses, and take thought
for us. And he said unto him, Behold
now, there is in this city a man
of God, and he is an honourable man;
all that he saith cometh surely to
pass: now let us go thither; peradventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
he can shew us our way that
we should go. And they went up
into the city: and when they were
come into the city, behold, Samuel
came out against them, for to go up
to the high place. Now the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had
told Samuel in his ear a day before
Saul came, saying, To morrow about
this time I will send thee a man out of
the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt
anoint him to be captain over my people
Israel, that he may save my people
out of the hand of the Philistines:
for I have looked upon my people, because
their cry is come unto me. And
when Samuel saw Saul, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said
unto him, Behold the man whom I
spake to thee of! this same shall
reign over my people. Then Saul
drew near to Samuel in the gate, and
said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the
seer's house is. And Samuel answered
Saul, and said, I am the seer:
go up before me unto the high place;
for ye shall eat with me to day, and to
morrow I will let thee go, and will
tell thee all that is in thine heart.
And as for thine asses that were lost
three days ago, set not thy mind on
them; for they are found. And on
whom is all the desire of Israel? Is
it not on thee, and on all thy father's
house? And Saul answered and said,
Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest
of the tribes of Israel? and my family
the least of all the families of the
tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then
speakest thou so to me? And Samuel
took Saul and his servant, and
brought them into the parlour, and
made them sit in the chiefest place
among them that were bidden, which
were about thirty persons. So Saul
did eat with Samuel that day.</div>

<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 10</div>

<p>And when they were come down
from the high place into the city,
Samuel communed with Saul upon
the top of the house. And they arose
early: and it came to pass about the
spring of the day, that Samuel called
Saul to the top of the house, saying,
Up, that I may send thee away. And
Saul arose, and they went out both of
them, he and Samuel, abroad. And
as they were going down to the end of
the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the
servant pass on before us, (and he
passed on,) but stand thou still a
while, that I may shew thee the word
of God. Then Samuel took a vial of
oil, and poured it upon his head, and
kissed him, and said, Is it not because
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath anointed thee
to be captain over his inheritance?
When thou art departed from me to
day, then thou shalt find two men by
Rachel's sepulchre in the border of
Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will
say unto thee, The asses which thou
wentest to seek are found: and, lo,
thy father hath left the care of the
asses, and sorroweth for you, saying,
What shall I do for my son? Then
shalt thou go on forward from thence,
and thou shalt come to the plain of
Tabor, and there shall meet thee
three men going up to God to Beth-el,
one carrying three kids, and another
carrying three loaves of bread,
and another carrying a bottle of
wine: and they will salute thee, and
give thee two loaves of bread; which
thou shalt receive of their hands.
After that thou shalt come to the hill
of God, where is the garrison of the
Philistines: and it shall come to pass,
when thou art come thither to the
city, that thou shalt meet a company
of prophets coming down from the
high place with a psaltery, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before
them; and they shall prophesy:
and the Spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will come
upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy
with them, and shalt be turned into
another man. And it was so, that
when he had turned his back to go
from Samuel, God gave him another
heart: and all those signs came to
pass that day.</p>

<p>And Samuel called the people together
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to Mizpeh; and
said, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel,
I brought up Israel out of
Egypt, and delivered you out of the
hand of the Egyptians, and out of
the hand of all kingdoms, and of
them that oppressed you: and ye have
this day rejected your God, who himself
saved you out of all your adversities
and your tribulations; and ye
have said unto him, Nay, but set a
king over us. Now therefore present
yourselves before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
by your tribes, and by your thousands.
And when Samuel had caused
all the tribes of Israel to come near,
the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin
to come near by their families,
the family of Matri was taken, and
Saul the son of Kish was taken: and
when they sought him, he could not
be found. Therefore they enquired
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> further, if the man
should yet come thither. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> answered, Behold, he hath hid
himself among the stuff. And they
ran and fetched him thence: and
when he stood among the people, he
was higher than any of the people
from his shoulders and upward. And
Samuel said to all the people, See ye
him whom the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath chosen, that
there is none like him among all the
people? And all the people shouted,
and said, God save the king. Then
Samuel told the people the manner of
the kingdom, and wrote it in a book,
and laid it up before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
Samuel sent all the people away,
every man to his house.</p>

<p>And all the people went to Gilgal;
and there they made Saul king before
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in Gilgal; and there
they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and there
Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced
greatly.</p>

<p>So Saul took the kingdom over
Israel, and fought against all his enemies
on every side, against Moab,
and against the children of Ammon,
and against Edom, and against the
kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines:
and whithersoever he turned
himself, he vexed them. And he
gathered an host, and smote the
Amalekites, and delivered Israel out
of the hands of them that spoiled
them. And there was sore war
against the Philistines all the days of
Saul: and when Saul saw any strong
man, or any valiant man, he took him
unto him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_80" id="CHAPTER_80">CHAPTER 80</a><br />

<small>SAUL REJECTED FOR
DISOBEDIENCE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 15</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>SAMUEL also said unto Saul,
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> sent me to anoint
thee to be king over his people,
over Israel: now therefore hearken
thou unto the voice of the words of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of
hosts, I remember that which Amalek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
did to Israel, how he laid wait for him
in the way, when he came up from
Egypt. Now go and smite Amalek,
and utterly destroy all that they have,
and spare them not; but slay both
man and woman, infant and suckling,
ox and sheep, camel and ass.
And Saul gathered the people together,
and numbered them in Telaim,
two hundred thousand footmen,
and ten thousand men of Judah. And
Saul came to a city of Amalek, and
laid wait in the valley. And Saul
smote the Amalekites from Havilah
until thou comest to Shur, that is
over against Egypt. And he took
Agag the king of the Amalekites
alive, and utterly destroyed all the
people with the edge of the sword.
But Saul and the people spared Agag,
and the best of the sheep, and of the
oxen, and of the fatlings, and the
lambs, and all that was good, and
would not utterly destroy them: but
everything that was vile and refuse,
that they destroyed utterly.</div>

<p>Then came the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
unto Samuel, saying, It repenteth me
that I have set up Saul to be king:
for he is turned back from following
me, and hath not performed my commandments.
And it grieved Samuel;
and he cried unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> all
night. And Samuel came to Saul:
and Saul said unto him, Blessed be
thou of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: I have performed
the commandment of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
Samuel said, What meaneth then this
bleating of the sheep in mine ears,
and the lowing of the oxen which I
hear? And Saul said, They have
brought them from the Amalekites:
for the people spared the best of the
sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God; and the rest
we have utterly destroyed. Then
Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I
will tell thee what the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath said
to me this night. And he said unto
him, Say on. And Samuel said, When
thou wast little in thine own sight,
wast thou not made the head of
the tribes of Israel, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
anointed thee king over Israel? And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> sent thee on a journey, and
said, Go and utterly destroy the
sinners the Amalekites, and fight
against them until they be consumed.
Wherefore then didst thou not obey
the voice of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, but didst fly
upon the spoil, and didst evil in the
sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? And Samuel said,
Hath the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> as great delight in
burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in
obeying the voice of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? Behold,
to obey is better than sacrifice,
and to hearken than the fat of rams.
For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft,
and stubbornness is as iniquity
and idolatry. Because thou
hast rejected the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
he hath also rejected thee from being
king.</p>

<p>And Saul said unto Samuel, I have
sinned: for I have transgressed the
commandment of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and thy
words: because I feared the people,
and obeyed their voice. Now therefore,
I pray thee, pardon my sin, and
turn again with me, that I may worship
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Samuel said unto
Saul, I will not return with thee:
for thou hast rejected the word of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath rejected
thee from being king over Israel.
And as Samuel turned about to go
away, he laid hold upon the skirt of
his mantle, and it rent. And Samuel
said unto him, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath rent
the kingdom of Israel from thee this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
day, and hath given it to a neighbour
of thine, that is better than thou.
And also the Strength of Israel will
not lie nor repent: for he is not a man,
that he should repent. Then he said,
I have sinned: yet honour me now,
I pray thee, before the elders of my
people, and before Israel, and turn
again with me, that I may worship
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God. So Samuel turned
again after Saul; and Saul worshipped
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither
to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.
And Agag came unto him
delicately. And Agag said, Surely
the bitterness of death is past. And
Samuel said, As thy sword hath made
women childless, so shall thy mother
be childless among women. And
Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in Gilgal.</p>

<p>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and
Saul went up to his house to Gibeah
of Saul. And Samuel came no more
to see Saul until the day of his death:
nevertheless Samuel mourned for
Saul: and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> repented that he
had made Saul king over Israel.</p>

<small>DAVID CHOSEN KING</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 16</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Samuel,
How long wilt thou mourn for
Saul, seeing I have rejected
him from reigning over Israel? fill
thine horn with oil, and go, I will
send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite:
for I have provided me a king among
his sons. And Samuel did that which
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake, and came to Beth-lehem.
And the elders of the town
trembled at his coming, and said,
Comest thou peaceably? And he
said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: sanctify yourselves,
and come with me to the sacrifice.
And he sanctified Jesse and
his sons, and called them to the
sacrifice.</div>

<p>And it came to pass, when they
were come, that he looked on Eliab,
and said, Surely the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> anointed
is before him. But the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said
unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance,
or on the height of his stature;
because I have refused him:
for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> seeth not as man seeth;
for man looketh on the outward appearance,
but the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> looketh on
the heart. Again, Jesse made seven
of his sons to pass before Samuel.
And Samuel said unto Jesse, The
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath not chosen these. And
Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all
thy children? And he said, There
remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold,
he keepeth the sheep. And
Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and
fetch him: for we will not sit down
till he come hither. And he sent,
and brought him in. Now he was
ruddy, and withal of a beautiful
countenance, and goodly to look to.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said, Arise, anoint him:
for this is he. Then Samuel took the
horn of oil, and anointed him in the
midst of his brethren: and the Spirit
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came upon David from
that day forward. So Samuel rose
up, and went to Ramah.</p>

<p>But the Spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> departed
from Saul, and an evil spirit from the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> troubled him. And Saul's servants
said unto him, Behold now, an
evil spirit from God troubleth thee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Let our lord now command thy servants,
which are before thee, to seek
out a man, who is a cunning player on
an harp: and it shall come to pass,
when the evil spirit from God is upon
thee, that he shall play with his hand,
and thou shalt be well. And Saul
said unto his servants, Provide me
now a man that can play well, and
bring him to me. Then answered one
of the servants, and said, Behold, I
have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite,
that is cunning in playing,
and a mighty valiant man, and a man
of war, and prudent in matters, and
a comely person, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is with
him.</p>

<p>Wherefore Saul sent messengers
unto Jesse, and said, Send me David
thy son, which is with the sheep. And
Jesse took an ass laden with bread,
and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and
sent them by David his son unto Saul.
And David came to Saul, and stood
before him: and he loved him greatly;
and he became his armourbearer.
And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let
David, I pray thee, stand before me;
for he hath found favour in my sight.
And it came to pass, when the evil
spirit from God was upon Saul, that
David took an harp, and played with
his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and
was well, and the evil spirit departed
from him.</p>

<small>DAVID CONQUERS GOLIATH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 17</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW the Philistines gathered
together their armies to battle.
And Saul and the men
of Israel were gathered together, and
pitched by the valley of Elah, and set
the battle in array against the Philistines.
And the Philistines stood on
a mountain on the one side, and Israel
stood on a mountain on the other
side: and there was a valley between
them. And there went out a champion
out of the camp of the Philistines,
named Goliath, of Gath, whose height
was six cubits and a span. And he
had an helmet of brass upon his head,
and he was armed with a coat of mail;
and the weight of the coat was five
thousand shekels of brass. And he
had greaves of brass upon his legs,
and a target of brass between his
shoulders. And the staff of his spear
was like a weaver's beam; and his
spear's head weighed six hundred
shekels of iron: and one bearing a
shield went before him. And he
stood and cried unto the armies of
Israel, and said unto them, Why are
ye come out to set your battle in array?
am not I a Philistine, and ye
servants to Saul? choose you a man
for you, and let him come down to me.
If he be able to fight with me, and to
kill me, then will we be your servants:
but if I prevail against him,
and kill him, then shall ye be our servants,
and serve us. And the Philistine
said, I defy the armies of
Israel this day; give me a man, that
we may fight together. When Saul
and all Israel heard those words of
the Philistine, they were dismayed,
and greatly afraid.</div>

<p>Now David was the son of that
Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah,
whose name was Jesse. And the
three eldest sons of Jesse went and
followed Saul to the battle: and the
names of his three sons that went to
the battle were Eliab the firstborn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and next unto him Abinadab, and the
third Shammah. And David was the
youngest: and the three eldest followed
Saul. But David went and returned
from Saul to feed his father's
sheep at Beth-lehem. And the Philistine
drew near morning and evening,
and presented himself forty days.
And Jesse said unto David his son,
Take now for thy brethren an ephah
of this parched corn, and these ten
loaves, and run to the camp to thy
brethren; and carry these ten cheeses
unto the captain of their thousand,
and look how thy brethren fare, and
take their pledge.</p>

<p>And David rose up early in the
morning, and left the sheep with a
keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse
had commanded him; and he came to
the trench, as the host was going forth
to the fight, and shouted for the battle.
And David left his carriage in
the hand of the keeper of the carriage,
and ran into the army, and
came and saluted his brethren. And
as he talked with them, behold, there
came up the champion, the Philistine
of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the
armies of the Philistines, and spake
according to the same words: and
David heard them. And all the men
of Israel, when they saw the man,
fled from him, and were sore afraid.
And the men of Israel said, Have ye
seen this man that is come up? surely
to defy Israel is he come up: and it
shall be, that the man who killeth
him, the king will enrich him with
great riches, and will give him his
daughter, and make his father's
house free in Israel.</p>

<p>And David spake to the men that
stood by him, saying, What shall be
done to the man that killeth this Philistine,
and taketh away the reproach
from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised
Philistine, that he should
defy the armies of the living God?
And the people answered him after
this manner, saying, So shall it be
done to the man that killeth him.
And when the words were heard
which David spake, they rehearsed
them before Saul: and he sent for
him.</p>

<p>And David said to Saul, Let no
man's heart fail because of him; thy
servant will go and fight with this
Philistine. And Saul said to David,
Thou art not able to go against this
Philistine to fight with him: for thou
art but a youth, and he a man of
war from his youth. And David said
unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's
sheep, and there came a lion,
and a bear, and took a lamb out of the
flock: and I went out after him, and
smote him, and delivered it out of
his mouth: and when he arose against
me, I caught him by his beard, and
smote him, and slew him. Thy servant
slew both the lion and the bear:
and this uncircumcised Philistine
shall be as one of them, seeing he hath
defied the armies of the living God.
David said moreover, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that
delivered me out of the paw of the
lion, and out of the paw of the bear,
he will deliver me out of the hand
of this Philistine. And Saul said
unto David, Go, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> be with
thee. And Saul armed David with
his armour, and he put an helmet of
brass upon his head; also he armed
him with a coat of mail. And David
girded his sword upon his armour,
and he assayed to go; for he had not
proved it.</p>

<p>And David said unto Saul, I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
go with these; for I have not
proved them. And David put them
off him. And he took his staff in his
hand, and chose him five smooth
stones out of the brook, and put them
in a shepherd's bag which he had,
even in a scrip; and his sling was in
his hand: and he drew near to the
Philistine. And the Philistine came
on and drew near unto David; and
the man that bare the shield went before
him. And when the Philistine
looked about, and saw David, he disdained
him: for he was but a youth,
and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
And the Philistine said unto David,
Am I a dog, that thou comest to me
with staves? And the Philistine
cursed David by his gods. And the
Philistine said to David, Come to me,
and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls
of the air, and to the beasts of the
field. Then said David to the Philistine,
Thou comest to me with a sword,
and with a spear, and with a shield:
but I come to thee in the name of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of the armies
of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
This day will the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> deliver thee
into mine hand; and I will smite thee,
and take thine head from thee; and I
will give the carcases of the host of
the Philistines this day unto the fowls
of the air, and to the wild beasts of
the earth; that all the earth may
know that there is a God in Israel.
And all this assembly shall know that
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> saveth not with sword and
spear: for the battle is the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>,
and he will give you into our hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 18</div>

<p>And it came to pass, when the Philistine
arose, and came and drew nigh
to meet David, that David hasted,
and ran toward the army to meet the
Philistine. And David put his hand
in his bag, and took thence a stone,
and slang it, and smote the Philistine
in his forehead, that the stone sunk
into his forehead; and he fell upon
his face to the earth.</p>

<p>So David prevailed over the Philistine
with a sling and with a stone,
and smote the Philistine, and slew
him; but there was no sword in the
hand of David. Therefore David
ran, and stood upon the Philistine,
and took his sword, and drew it out
of the sheath thereof, and slew him,
and cut off his head therewith. And
when the Philistines saw their champion
was dead, they fled. And the
men of Israel and of Judah arose,
and shouted, and pursued the Philistines,
until thou come to the valley,
and to the gates of Ekron. And the
wounded of the Philistines fell down
by the way to Shaaraim, even unto
Gath, and unto Ekron. And the children
of Israel returned from chasing
after the Philistines, and they spoiled
their tents. And David took the head
of the Philistine, and brought it to
Jerusalem; but he put his armour in
his tent. And as David returned
from the slaughter of the Philistine,
Abner took him, and brought him before
Saul with the head of the Philistine
in his hand.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_83" id="CHAPTER_83">CHAPTER 83</a><br />

<small>DAVID AND JONATHAN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 18</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, when he had
made an end of speaking unto
Saul, that the soul of Jonathan
was knit with the soul of David,
and Jonathan loved him as his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
soul. And Saul took him that day,
and would let him go no more home
to his father's house. Then Jonathan
and David made a covenant, because
he loved him as his own soul. And
Jonathan stripped himself of the robe
that was upon him, and gave it to
David, and his garments, even to his
sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
And David went out whithersoever
Saul sent him, and behaved
himself wisely: and Saul set him over
the men of war, and he was accepted
in the sight of all the people, and also
in the sight of Saul's servants. And
it came to pass as they came, when
David was returned from the slaughter
of the Philistine, that the women
came out of all cities of Israel, singing
and dancing, to meet king Saul,
with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments
of musick. And the women
answered one another as they
played, and said, Saul hath slain his
thousands, and David his ten thousands.
And Saul was very wroth, and
the saying displeased him; and he
said, They have ascribed unto David
ten thousands, and to me they have
ascribed but thousands: and what can
he have more but the kingdom? And
Saul eyed David from that day and
forward.</div>

<p>And it came to pass on the morrow,
that the evil spirit from God came
upon Saul, and he prophesied in the
midst of the house: and David played
with his hand, as at other times: and
there was a javelin in Saul's hand.
And Saul cast the javelin; for he said,
I will smite David even to the wall
with it. And David avoided out of
his presence twice. And Saul was
afraid of David, because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
was with him, and was departed from
Saul. Therefore Saul removed him
from him, and made him his captain
over a thousand; and he went out and
came in before the people. And
David behaved himself wisely in all
his ways; and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was with him.
But all Israel and Judah loved David,
because he went out and came in
before them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 19</div>

<p>And Michal Saul's daughter loved
David: and they told Saul, and the
thing pleased him. And Saul said,
I will give him her, that she may be
a snare to him, and that the hand of
the Philistines may be against him.
And Saul commanded his servants,
saying, Commune with David secretly,
and say, Behold, the king hath delight
in thee, and all his servants love
thee: now therefore be the king's
son in law. And Saul's servants
spake those words in the ears of David.
And David said, Seemeth it to
you a light thing to be a king's son
in law, seeing that I am a poor man,
and lightly esteemed? And the servants
of Saul told him, saying, On
this manner spake David. And Saul
said, Thus shall ye say to David, The
king desireth not any dowry, but to
be avenged of the king's enemies.
But Saul thought to make David fall
by the hand of the Philistines. And
when his servants told David these
words, it pleased David well to be
the king's son in law. Wherefore
David arose and went, he and his
men, and slew of the Philistines two
hundred men. And Saul gave him
Michal his daughter to wife. And
Saul saw and knew that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was
with David, and that Michal Saul's
daughter loved him. And Saul was
yet the more afraid of David; and
Saul became David's enemy continually.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
And Saul spake to Jonathan
his son, and to all his servants, that
they should kill David. But Jonathan
Saul's son delighted much in
David: and Jonathan told David,
saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill
thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take
heed to thyself until the morning,
and abide in a secret place, and hide
thyself: and I will go out and stand
beside my father in the field where
thou art, and I will commune with
my father of thee; and what I see,
that I will tell thee.</p>

<p>And Jonathan spake good of David
unto Saul his father, and said unto
him, Let not the king sin against his
servant, against David; because he
hath not sinned against thee, and because
his works have been to theeward
very good: for he did put his
life in his hand, and slew the Philistine,
and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> wrought a great
salvation for all Israel: thou sawest
it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then
wilt thou sin against innocent blood,
to slay David without a cause? And
Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan:
and Saul sware, As the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
liveth, he shall not be slain. And
Jonathan called David, and Jonathan
shewed him all those things. And
Jonathan brought David to Saul, and
he was in his presence, as in times
past.</p>

<p>And there was war again: and
David went out, and fought with the
Philistines, and slew them with a
great slaughter; and they fled from
him.</p>

<p>And the evil spirit from the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
was upon Saul, as he sat in his house
with his javelin in his hand: and David
played with his hand. And Saul
sought to smite David even to the
wall with the javelin; but he slipped
away out of Saul's presence, and he
smote the javelin into the wall: and
David fled, and escaped that night.
Saul also sent messengers unto David's
house, to watch him, and to slay
him in the morning: and Michal
David's wife told him, saying, If
thou save not thy life to night, to
morrow thou shalt be slain. So Michal
let David down through a window:
and he went, and fled, and escaped.
And Michal took an image,
and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow
of goats' hair for his bolster, and
covered it with a cloth. And when
Saul sent messengers to take David,
she said, He is sick. And Saul sent
the messengers again to see David,
saying, Bring him up to me in the
bed, that I may slay him. And when
the messengers were come in, behold,
there was an image in the bed, with a
pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.
And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast
thou deceived me so, and sent away
mine enemy, that he is escaped?
And Michal answered Saul, He said
unto me, Let me go; why should I
kill thee?</p>

<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 20 </div>

<p>So David fled, and escaped, and
came to Samuel to Ramah, and told
him all that Saul had done to him.
And he and Samuel went and dwelt
in Naioth. And David fled from Naioth
in Ramah, and came and said
before Jonathan, What have I done?
what is mine iniquity? and what is
my sin before thy father, that he
seeketh my life? And he said unto
him, God forbid; thou shalt not die:
behold, my father will do nothing
either great or small, but that he will
shew it me: and why should my
father hide this thing from me? it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
not so. And David sware moreover,
and said, Thy father certainly knoweth
that I have found grace in thine
eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan
know this, lest he be grieved: but
truly as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> liveth, and as thy
soul liveth, there is but a step between
me and death. Then said Jonathan
unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth,
I will even do it for thee.
And David said unto Jonathan, Behold,
to morrow is the new moon, and
I should not fail to sit with the king
at meat: but let me go, that I may
hide myself in the field unto the third
day at even. If thy father at all miss
me, then say, David earnestly asked
leave of me that he might run to
Beth-lehem his city: for there is a
yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
If he say thus, It is well; thy
servant shall have peace: but if he be
very wroth, then be sure that evil is
determined by him. And Jonathan
said unto David, Come, and let us go
out into the field. And they went out
both of them into the field. Then
Jonathan said to David, To morrow
is the new moon: and thou shalt be
missed, because thy seat will be
empty. And when thou hast stayed
three days, then thou shalt go down
quickly, and come to the place where
thou didst hide thyself when the
business was in hand, and shalt remain
by the stone Ezel. And I will
shoot three arrows on the side thereof,
as though I shot at a mark. And,
behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go,
find out the arrows. If I expressly
say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows
are on this side of thee, take them;
then come thou: for there is peace to
thee, and no hurt; as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> liveth.
But if I say thus unto the young
man, Behold, the arrows are beyond
thee; go thy way: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath
sent thee away.</p>

<p>So David hid himself in the field:
and when the new moon was come,
the king sat him down to eat meat.
And the king sat upon his seat, as at
other times, even upon a seat by the
wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner
sat by Saul's side, and David's place
was empty. Nevertheless Saul spake
not anything that day: for he thought,
Something hath befallen him, he is
not clean; surely he is not clean.
And it came to pass on the morrow,
which was the second day of the
month, that David's place was empty:
and Saul said unto Jonathan his son,
Wherefore cometh not the son of
Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor
to day? And Jonathan answered
Saul, David earnestly asked leave of
me to go to Beth-lehem: and he said,
Let me go, I pray thee; for our family
hath a sacrifice in the city; and my
brother, he hath commanded me to be
there: and now, if I have found favour
in thine eyes, let me get away,
I pray thee, and see my brethren.
Therefore he cometh not unto the
king's table. Then Saul's anger was
kindled against Jonathan, and he
said unto him, Thou son of the perverse
rebellious woman, do not I
know that thou hast chosen the son of
Jesse to thine own confusion? For
as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon
the ground, thou shalt not be established,
nor thy kingdom. Wherefore
now send and fetch him unto me, for
he shall surely die. And Jonathan
answered Saul his father, and said
unto him, Wherefore shall he be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
slain? what hath he done? And
Saul cast a javelin at him to smite
him: whereby Jonathan knew that it
was determined of his father to slay
David. So Jonathan arose from
the table in fierce anger, and did
eat no meat the second day of the
month: for he was grieved for David,
because his father had done him
shame.</p>

<p>And it came to pass in the morning,
that Jonathan went out into the field
at the time appointed with David,
and a little lad with him. And
he said unto his lad, Run, find out now
the arrows which I shoot. And as the
lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond
him. And when the lad was come
to the place of the arrow which Jonathan
had shot, Jonathan cried after
the lad, and said, Is not the arrow
beyond thee? And Jonathan cried
after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay
not. And Jonathan's lad gathered
up the arrows, and came to his master.
But the lad knew not any thing:
only Jonathan and David knew the
matter. And Jonathan gave his artillery
unto his lad, and said unto him,
Go, carry them to the city.</p>

<p>And as soon as the lad was gone,
David arose out of a place toward
the south, and fell on his face to the
ground, and bowed himself three
times: and they kissed one another,
and wept one with another, until David
exceeded. And Jonathan said to
David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we
have sworn both of us in the name of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, saying, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> be between
me and thee, and between my
seed and thy seed for ever. And he
arose and departed: and Jonathan
went into the city.</p>

<small>SAUL PURSUES DAVID</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 21</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THEN came David to Nob, and
asked Ahimelech the priest
for bread. So the priest gave
him hallowed bread.</div>

<p>And David said unto Ahimelech,
And is there not here under thine
hand spear or sword? for I have
neither brought my sword nor my
weapons with me, because the king's
business required haste. And the
priest said, The sword of Goliath the
Philistine, whom thou slewest in the
valley of Elah, behold, it is here
wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod:
if thou wilt take that, take it: for
there is no other save that here. And
David said, There is none like that;
give it me. And David arose, and fled
that day for fear of Saul, and went to
Achish the king of Gath. And the
servants of Achish said unto him, Is
not this David the king of the land?
did they not sing one to another of
him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain
his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
And David laid up these
words in his heart, and was sore
afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
And he departed thence, and escaped
to the cave Adullam: and when his
brethren and all his father's house
heard it, they went down thither to
him. And every one that was in distress,
and every one that was in debt,
and every one that was discontented,
gathered themselves unto him; and
he became a captain over them: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
there were with him about four hundred
men. And David went thence to
Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto
the king of Moab, Let my father and
my mother, I pray thee, come forth,
and be with you, till I know what God
will do for me. And he brought them
before the king of Moab: and they
dwelt with him all the while that David
was in the hold. And the prophet
Gad said unto David, Abide not in
the hold; depart, and get thee into the
land of Judah.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 23</div>

<p>When Saul heard that David was
discovered, and that Ahimelech had
given him the hallowed bread, and
the sword of Goliath the Philistine, he
sent to call Ahimelech the priest.
And the king said, Thou shalt surely
die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's
house. And the king said unto
the footmen that stood about him,
Turn, and slay the priests of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>; because their hand also is with
David, and because they knew when
he fled, and did not shew it to me.
But the servants of the king would
not put forth their hand to fall upon
the priests of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the king
said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon
the priests. And Doeg the Edomite
turned, and he fell upon the priests,
and slew on that day fourscore and
five persons that did wear a linen
ephod. And Nob, the city of the
priests, smote he with the edge of the
sword, both men and women, children
and sucklings, and oxen, and asses,
and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
And one of the sons of Ahimelech the
son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped,
and fled after David. And
Abiathar shewed David that Saul had
slain the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> priests. And David
said unto Abiathar, Abide thou with
me, fear not: for he that seeketh my
life seeketh thy life: but with me thou
shalt be in safeguard.</p>

<p>And David abode in the wilderness
in strong holds, and remained in a
mountain in the wilderness of Ziph.
And Saul sought him every day, but
God delivered him not into his hand.
And David saw that Saul was come
out to seek his life: and David was in
the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.</p>

<p>And Jonathan Saul's son arose,
and went to David into the wood, and
strengthened his hand in God. And
he said unto him, Fear not: for the
hand of Saul my father shall not find
thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel,
and I shall be next unto thee;
and that also Saul my father knoweth.
And they two made a covenant before
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and David abode in
the wood, and Jonathan went to his
house.</p>

<p>And David made haste to get away
for fear of Saul; for Saul and his
men compassed David and his men
round about to take them. But there
came a messenger unto Saul, saying,
Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines
have invaded the land. Wherefore
Saul returned from pursuing
after David, and went against the
Philistines. And David went up
from thence, and dwelt in strong
holds at En-gedi.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Saul was
returned from following the Philistines,
that it was told him, saying,
Behold, David is in the wilderness of
En-gedi. Then Saul took three thousand
chosen men out of all Israel, and
went to seek David and his men upon
the rocks of the wild goats. And he
came to the sheepcotes by the way,
where was a cave; and Saul went in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to the cave: and David and his men
remained in the sides of the cave.
And the men of David said unto him,
Behold the day of which the LORD
said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver
thine enemy into thine hand, that thou
mayest do to him as it shall seem
good unto thee. Then David arose,
and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe
privily. And it came to pass afterward,
that David's heart smote him,
because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
And he said unto his men, The LORD
forbid that I should do this thing unto
my master, the LORD'S anointed, to
stretch forth mine hand against him,
seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.
So David stayed his servants with
these words, and suffered them not
to rise against Saul. But Saul rose
up out of the cave, and went on his
way. David also arose afterward,
and went out of the cave, and cried
after Saul, saying, My lord the king.
And when Saul looked behind him,
David stooped with his face to the
earth, and bowed himself.</p>

<p>And David said to Saul, Wherefore
hearest thou men's words, saying,
Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? Behold,
this day thine eyes have seen
how that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had delivered thee
to day into mine hand in the cave:
and some bade me kill thee: but mine
eye spared thee; and I said, I will not
put forth mine hand against my
lord; for he is the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> anointed.
Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the
skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in
that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and
killed thee not, know thou and see
that there is neither evil nor transgression
in mine hand, and I have not
sinned against thee; yet thou huntest
my soul to take it. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> therefore
be judge, and judge between me
and thee, and see, and plead my
cause, and deliver me out of thine
hand.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when David
had made an end of speaking these
words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is
this thy voice, my son David? And
Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
And he said to David, Thou art more
righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded
me good, whereas I have rewarded
thee evil. And now, behold,
I know well that thou shalt surely be
king, and that the kingdom of Israel
shall be established in thine hand.
Swear now therefore unto me by the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that thou wilt not cut off my
seed after me, and that thou wilt not
destroy my name out of my father's
house. And David sware unto Saul.
And Saul went home; but David and
his men gat them up unto the hold.</p>

<p>And Samuel died; and all the Israelites
were gathered together, and lamented
him, and buried him in his
house at Ramah.</p>

<p>And David arose, and went down
to the wilderness of Paran.</p>

<small>DAVID SPARES SAUL'S LIFE
THE SECOND TIME</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 26</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the Ziphites came unto Saul
to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
David hide himself in the hill
of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?
Then Saul arose, and went
down to the wilderness of Ziph, having
three thousand chosen men of Israel
with him, to seek David in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
wilderness of Ziph. And Saul pitched
in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
Jeshimon, by the way. But David
abode in the wilderness, and he
saw that Saul came after him into the
wilderness. David therefore sent out
spies, and understood that Saul was
come in very deed.</div>

<p>And David arose, and came to the
place where Saul had pitched: and
David beheld the place where Saul
lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the
captain of his host: and Saul lay in
the trench, and the people pitched
round about him. Then David said,
Who will go down with me to Saul to
the camp? And Abishai said, I will
go down with thee. So David and
Abishai came to the people by night:
and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within
the trench, and his spear stuck in the
ground at his bolster: but Abner and
the people lay round about him. Then
said Abishai to David, God hath delivered
thine enemy into thine hand
this day: now therefore let me smite
him, I pray thee, with the spear even
to the earth at once, and I will not
smite him the second time. And David
said to Abishai, Destroy him not:
for who can stretch forth his hand
against the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> anointed, and be
guiltless? David said furthermore,
As the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> liveth, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall
smite him; or his day shall come to
die; or he shall descend into battle,
and perish. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> forbid that
I should stretch forth mine hand
against the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> anointed: but, I
pray thee, take thou now the spear
that is at his bolster, and the cruse of
water, and let us go. So David took
the spear and the cruse of water from
Saul's bolster; and they gat them
away, and no man saw it, nor knew it,
neither awaked: for they were all
asleep; because a deep sleep from the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> was fallen upon them.</p>

<p>Then David went over to the other
side, and stood on the top of an hill
afar off; a great space being between
them: and David cried to the people,
and to Abner the son of Ner,
saying, Answerest thou not, Abner?
Then Abner answered and said, Who
art thou that criest to the king? And
David said to Abner, Art not thou a
valiant man? and who is like to thee
in Israel? wherefore then hast thou
not kept thy lord the king? for there
came one of the people in to destroy
the king thy lord. This thing is not
good that thou hast done. As the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> liveth, ye are worthy to die, because
ye have not kept your master,
the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> anointed. And now see
where the king's spear is, and the
cruse of water that was at his bolster.
And Saul knew David's voice, and
said, Is this thy voice, my son David?
And David said, It is my voice, my
lord, O king. And he said, Wherefore
doth my lord thus pursue after
his servant? for what have I done? or
what evil is in mine hand? Then said
Saul, I have sinned: return, my son
David: for I will no more do thee
harm, because my soul was precious
in thine eyes this day: behold, I have
played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
And David answered and
said, Behold the king's spear! and let
one of the young men come over and
fetch it. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> render to every
man his righteousness and his faithfulness:
for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> delivered thee
into my hand to day, but I would not
stretch forth mine hand against the
<span class="smcap">Lord's</span> anointed. And, behold, as thy
life was much set by this day in mine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
eyes, so let my life be much set by in
the eyes of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and let him deliver
me out of all tribulation. Then
Saul said to David, Blessed be thou,
my son David: thou shalt both do
great things, and also shalt still prevail.
So David went on his way, and
Saul returned to his place.</p>

<p>And David said in his heart, I shall
now perish one day by the hand of
Saul: there is nothing better for me
than that I should speedily escape
into the land of the Philistines; and
Saul shall despair of me, to seek me
any more in any coast of Israel: so
shall I escape out of his hand. And
David arose, and he passed over
with the six hundred men that were
with him unto Achish, king of Gath.
And it was told Saul that David was
fled to Gath: and he sought no more
again for him.</p>

<small>SAUL CONSULTS THE WITCH
OF EN-DOR</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 28</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW Samuel was dead, and all
Israel had lamented him, and
buried him in Ramah, even
in his own city. And Saul had put
away those that had familiar spirits,
and the wizards, out of the land. And
the Philistines gathered themselves
together, and came and pitched in
Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel
together, and they pitched in Gilboa.
And when Saul saw the host of the
Philistines, he was afraid, and his
heart greatly trembled. And when
Saul enquired of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
answered him not, neither by dreams,
nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</div>

<p>Then said Saul unto his servants,
Seek me a woman that hath a familiar
spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire
of her. And his servants said
to him, Behold, there is a woman that
hath a familiar spirit at En-dor. And
Saul disguised himself, and put on
other raiment, and he went, and two
men with him, and they came to the
woman by night: and he said, I pray
thee, divine unto me by the familiar
spirit, and bring me him up, whom I
shall name unto thee. And the woman
said unto him, Behold, thou
knowest what Saul hath done, how he
hath cut off those that have familiar
spirits, and the wizards, out of the
land: wherefore then layest thou a
snare for my life, to cause me to die?
And Saul sware to her by the LORD,
saying, As the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> liveth, there shall
no punishment happen to thee for
this thing. Then said the woman,
Whom shall I bring up unto thee?
And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
And when the woman saw Samuel,
she cried with a loud voice: and the
woman spake to Saul, saying, Why
hast thou deceived me? for thou art
Saul. And the king said unto her,
Be not afraid: for what sawest thou?
And the woman said unto Saul, I saw
gods ascending out of the earth. And
he said unto her, What form is he of?
And she said, An old man cometh up;
and he is covered with a mantle. And
Saul perceived that it was Samuel,
and he stooped with his face to the
ground, and bowed himself.</p>

<p>And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast
thou disquieted me, to bring me up?
And Saul answered, I am sore distressed;
for the Philistines make war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
against me, and God is departed from
me, and answereth me no more, neither
by prophets, nor by dreams:
therefore I have called thee, that thou
mayest make known unto me what I
shall do. Then said Samuel, Wherefore
then dost thou ask of me, seeing
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is departed from thee, and
is become thine enemy? Moreover
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will also deliver Israel with
thee into the hand of the Philistines:
and to morrow shalt thou and thy
sons be with me: the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> also shall
deliver the host of Israel into the
hand of the Philistines. Then Saul
fell straightway all along on the earth,
and was sore afraid, because of the
words of Samuel: and there was no
strength in him; for he had eaten no
bread all the day, nor all the night.</p>

<p>And the woman came unto Saul,
and saw that he was sore troubled,
and said unto him, Behold, thine
handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and
I have put my life in my hand, and
have hearkened unto thy words which
thou spakest unto me. Now therefore,
I pray thee, hearken thou also
unto the voice of thine handmaid,
and let me set a morsel of bread before
thee; and eat, that thou mayest
have strength, when thou goest on thy
way. But he refused, and said, I will
not eat. But his servants, together
with the woman, compelled him; and
he hearkened unto their voice. So
he arose from the earth, and sat upon
the bed. And the woman had a fat
calf in the house; and she hasted, and
killed it, and took flour, and kneaded
it, and did bake unleavened bread
thereof: and she brought it before
Saul, and before his servants; and
they did eat. Then they rose up, and
went away that night.</p>

<small>THE DEATH OF SAUL</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Samuel 31</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW the Philistines fought
against Israel: and the men
of Israel fled from before the
Philistines, and fell down slain in
mount Gilboa. And the Philistines
followed hard upon Saul and upon
his sons; and the Philistines slew
Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua,
Saul's sons. And the battle went
sore against Saul, and the archers
hit him; and he was sore wounded
of the archers. Then said Saul unto
his armourbearer, Draw thy sword,
and thrust me through therewith; lest
these uncircumcised come and thrust
me through, and abuse me. But his
armourbearer would not; for he was
sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a
sword, and fell upon it. And when
his armourbearer saw that Saul was
dead, he fell likewise upon his sword,
and died with him. So Saul died,
and his three sons, and his armourbearer,
and all his men, that same day
together.</div>

<p>And when the men of Israel that
were on the other side of the valley,
and they that were on the other side
Jordan, saw that the men of Israel
fled, and that Saul and his sons were
dead, they forsook the cities, and fled;
and the Philistines came and dwelt
in them. And it came to pass on the
morrow, when the Philistines came to
strip the slain, that they found Saul
and his three sons fallen in mount
Gilboa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">II. SAMUEL 1</div>

<p>It came even to pass on the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
day, that, behold, a man came out of
the camp from Saul with his clothes
rent, and earth upon his head: and so
it was, when he came to David, that he
fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
And David said unto him, From
whence comest thou? And he said
unto him, Out of the camp of Israel
am I escaped. And David said unto
him, How went the matter? I pray
thee, tell me. And he answered, The
people are fled from the battle, and
many of the people also are fallen
and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his
son are dead also. And David said
unto the young man that told him,
How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan
his son be dead? And the
young man that told him said, As I
happened by chance upon mount Gilboa,
behold, Saul leaned upon his
spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen
followed hard after him. And
when he looked behind him, he saw
me, and called unto me. And I answered,
Here am I. And he said
unto me, Who art thou? And I answered
him, I am an Amalekite. He
said unto me again, Stand, I pray
thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish
is come upon me, because my
life is yet whole in me. So I stood
upon him, and slew him, because I
was sure that he could not live after
that he was fallen: and I took the
crown that was upon his head, and the
bracelet that was on his arm, and
have brought them hither unto my
lord. Then David took hold on his
clothes, and rent them; and likewise
all the men that were with him.</p>

<p>And David lamented with this lamentation
over Saul and over Jonathan
his son:</p>

<p>The beauty of Israel is slain upon
thy high places: how are the mighty
fallen!</p>

<p>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not
in the streets of Askelon; lest the
daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
lest the daughters of the uncircumcised
triumph.</p>

<p>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there
be no dew, neither let there be rain,
upon you, nor fields of offerings: for
there the shield of the mighty is vilely
cast away, the shield of Saul, as
though he had not been anointed with
oil.</p>

<p>From the blood of the slain, from
the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan
turned not back, and the sword
of Saul returned not empty.</p>

<p>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and
pleasant in their lives, and in their
death they were not divided: they
were swifter than eagles, they were
stronger than lions.</p>

<p>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over
Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with
other delights, who put on ornaments
of gold upon your apparel.</p>

<p>How are the mighty fallen in the
midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou
wast slain in thine high places.</p>

<p>I am distressed for thee, my brother
Jonathan: very pleasant hast
thou been unto me: thy love to me
was wonderful, passing the love of
women.</p>

<p>How are the mighty fallen, and the
weapons of war perished!</p>

<h2>BOOK VIII&mdash;DAVID THE KING</h2>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_88" id="CHAPTER_88">CHAPTER 88</a><br />

<small>DAVID ANOINTED KING</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="150" height="173" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">AND it came to pass
after this, that
David enquired
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, saying,
Shall I go
up into any of
the cities of Judah?
And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto
him, Go up. And David said, Whither
shall I go up? And he said, Unto
Hebron. So David went up thither:
and the men of Judah came, and there
they anointed David king over the
house of Judah. But Abner the son
of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took
Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and
brought him over to Mahanaim; and
made him king over all Israel. But
the house of Judah followed David.
And the time that David was king in
Hebron over the house of Judah was
seven years and six months.</div>

<p>And Abner the son of Ner, and the
servants of Ish-bosheth the son of
Saul, went out from Mahanaim to
Gibeon. And Joab the son of Zeruiah,
and the servants of David, went out,
and met together by the pool of Gibeon.
And there was a very sore
battle that day; and Abner was beaten,
and the men of Israel, before the
servants of David.</p>

<p>Now there was long war between
the house of Saul and the house of
David: but David waxed stronger
and stronger, and the house of Saul
waxed weaker and weaker. And Abner
was displeased with Ish-bosheth,
and revolted to David; and had communication
with the elders of Israel,
saying, Ye sought for David in times
past to be king over you: now then
do it: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath spoken of
David, saying, By the hand of my
servant David I will save my people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Israel out of the hand of the Philistines,
and out of the hand of all their
enemies. And Abner also spake in
the ears of Benjamin: and Abner
went also to speak in the ears of David
in Hebron all that seemed good to
Israel, and that seemed good to
the whole house of Benjamin. So
Abner came to David to Hebron, and
twenty men with him. And David
made Abner and the men that were
with him a feast. And Abner said
unto David, I will arise and go, and
will gather all Israel unto my lord the
king, that they may make a league
with thee, and that thou mayest reign
over all that thine heart desireth.
And David sent Abner away; and he
went in peace.</p>

<p>And, behold, the servants of David
and Joab came from pursuing a
troop, and brought in a great spoil
with them: but Abner was not with
David in Hebron; for he had sent him
away, and he was gone in peace.
When Joab and all the host that was
with him were come, they told Joab,
saying, Abner came to the king, and
he hath sent him away, and he is gone
in peace. Then Joab came to the
king, and said, What hast thou done?
behold, Abner came unto thee; why
is it that thou hast sent him away,
and he is quite gone? Thou knowest
Abner, that he came to deceive thee,
and to know thy going out and thy
coming in, and to know all that thou
doest. And when Joab was come out
from David, he sent messengers after
Abner, which brought him again from
the well of Sirah: but David knew it
not. And when Abner was returned
to Hebron, Joab took him aside in
the gate to speak with him quietly,
and smote him there under the fifth
rib, that he died, for the blood of
Asahel his brother. And afterward
when David heard it, he said, I and
my kingdom are guiltless before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> for ever from the blood of Abner
the son of Ner. And David said
to Joab, and to all the people that
were with him, Rend your clothes,
and gird you with sackcloth, and
mourn before Abner. And king David
himself followed the bier. And
they buried Abner in Hebron: and
the king lifted up his voice, and wept
at the grave of Abner; and all the
people wept.</p>

<div class="sidenote">II. Samuel 5</div>

<p>Then came all the tribes of Israel
to David unto Hebron, and spake,
saying, Behold, we are thy bone and
thy flesh. Also in time past, when
Saul was king over us, thou wast he
that leddest out and broughtest in
Israel: and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said to thee,
Thou shalt feed my people Israel,
and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.
So all the elders of Israel came
to the king to Hebron; and king David
made a league with them in Hebron
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and they
anointed David king over Israel.
David was thirty years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned forty
years. In Hebron he reigned over
Judah seven years and six months:
and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty
and three years over all Israel and
Judah.</p>

<p>And the king and his men went to
Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants
of the land: which spake
unto David, saying, Thou shalt not
come in hither. Nevertheless David
took the strong hold of Zion: the same
is the city of David. And David went
on, and grew great, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God
of hosts was with him.</p>

<small>DAVID BRINGS THE ARK
TO ZION</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Samuel 6</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AGAIN, David gathered together
all the chosen men of Israel,
thirty thousand. And David
arose, and went with all the people
that were with him from Baale of
Judah, to bring up from thence the
ark of God, whose name is called by
the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts that
dwelleth between the cherubims.
And they set the ark of God upon a
new cart, and brought it out of the
house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah:
and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons
of Abinadab, drave the new cart.
And when they came to Nachon's
threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his
hand to the ark of God, and took hold
of it; for the oxen shook it. And the
anger of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was kindled against
Uzzah; and God smote him there for
his error; and there he died by the
ark of God. And David was displeased,
because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had made
a breach upon Uzzah: and he called
the name of the place Perez-uzzah to
this day. And David was afraid of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that day, and said, How shall
the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> come to me? So
David would not remove the ark of
the LORD unto him into the city of David:
but David carried it aside into
the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
And the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> continued
in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite
three months: and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> blessed
Obed-edom, and all his household.</div>

<p>And it was told king David, saying,
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath blessed the house of
Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth
unto him, because of the ark of God.
So David went and brought up the
ark of God from the house of Obed-edom
into the city of David with
gladness. And David danced before
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> with all his might; and David
was girded with a linen ephod.
So David and all the house of Israel
brought up the ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> with
shouting, and with the sound of the
trumpet. And they brought in the
ark of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and set it in his place,
in the midst of the tabernacle that
David had pitched for it: and David
offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And as
soon as David had made an end of
offering burnt offerings and peace
offerings, he blessed the people in
the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts. And
he dealt among all the people, even
among the whole multitude of Israel,
as well to the women as men, to every
one a cake of bread, and a good piece
of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all
the people departed every one to his
house.</p>

<p>And after this it came to pass, that
David smote the Philistines, and
subdued them. And he smote Moab:
and the Moabites became David's
servants, and brought gifts. He
smote also the Syrians, and dedicated
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> the silver and gold of
all the nations which he subdued.</p>

that is left of the house of
Saul, that I may shew him
kindness for Jonathan's sake? And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
there was of the house of Saul a servant
whose name was Ziba. And
when they had called him unto David,
the king said unto him, Art thou
Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is
he. And the king said, Is there not
yet any of the house of Saul, that I
may shew the kindness of God unto
him? And Ziba said unto the king,
Jonathan hath yet a son, which is
lame on his feet. And the king said
unto him, Where is he? And Ziba
said unto the king, Behold, he is in
the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel,
in Lo-debar. Then king David
sent, and fetched him out of the house
of Machir. Now when Mephibosheth,
the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
was come unto David, he fell on his
face, and did reverence. And David
said, Mephibosheth. And he answered,
Behold thy servant! And
David said unto him, Fear not: for I
will surely shew thee kindness for
Jonathan thy father's sake, and will
restore thee all the land of Saul thy
father; and thou shalt eat bread at
my table continually. And he bowed
himself, and said, What is thy servant,
that thou shouldest look upon
such a dead dog as I am? Then the
king called to Ziba, Saul's servant,
and said unto him, I have given unto
thy master's son all that pertained to
Saul and to all his house. Thou
therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants,
shall till the land for him, and
thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy
master's son may have food to eat:
but Mephibosheth thy master's son
shall eat bread alway at my table.
Then said Ziba unto the king, According
to all that my lord the king
hath commanded his servant, so shall
thy servant do. So Mephibosheth
dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat
continually at the king's table; and
was lame on both his feet.</div>

<small>DAVID TAKES THE WIFE
OF URIAH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Samuel 11</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, after the
year was expired, at the time
when kings go forth to battle,
that David sent Joab, and his servants
with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed
the children of Ammon, and
besieged Rabbah. But David tarried
still at Jerusalem. And it came to
pass in an eveningtide, that David
arose from off his bed, and walked
upon the roof of the king's house:
and from the roof he saw a woman
washing herself; and the woman was
very beautiful to look upon. And David
sent and enquired after the woman.
And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba,
the daughter of Eliam, the
wife of Uriah the Hittite? And David
sent messengers, and took her.
And David sent to Joab, saying, Send
me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent
Uriah to David. And David wrote a
letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand
of Uriah. And he wrote in the letter,
saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront
of the hottest battle, and retire ye
from him, that he may be smitten, and
die. And it came to pass, when Joab
observed the city, that he assigned
Uriah unto a place where he knew
that valiant men were. And the men
of the city went out, and fought with
Joab: and there fell some of the people
of the servants of David; and
Uriah the Hittite died also. Then
Joab sent and told David all the
things concerning the war. So the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
messenger went, and came and shewed
David all that Joab had sent him for.
And the messenger said unto David,
Surely the men prevailed against us,
and came out unto us into the field,
and we were upon them even unto
the entering of the gate. And the
shooters shot from off the wall upon
thy servants; and some of the king's
servants be dead, and thy servant
Uriah the Hittite is dead also. Then
David said unto the messenger, Thus
shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this
thing displease thee, for the sword
devoureth one as well as another:
make thy battle more strong against
the city, and overthrow it: and encourage
thou him. And when the
wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her
husband was dead, she mourned for
her husband. And when the mourning
was past, David sent and fetched
her to his house, and she became his
wife, and bare him a son. But the
thing that David had done displeased
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</div>

<div class="sidenote">II. Samuel 12</div>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> sent Nathan unto David.
And he came unto him, and said
unto him, There were two men in one
city; the one rich, and the other poor.
The rich man had exceeding many
flocks and herds: but the poor man
had nothing, save one little ewe lamb,
which he had bought and nourished
up: and it grew up together with him,
and with his children; it did eat of
his own meat, and drank of his own
cup, and lay in his bosom, and was
unto him as a daughter. And there
came a traveller unto the rich man,
and he spared to take of his own
flock and of his own herd, to dress
for the wayfaring man that was come
unto him; but took the poor man's
lamb, and dressed it for the man that
was come to him. And David's anger
was greatly kindled against the man;
and he said to Nathan, As the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
liveth, the man that hath done this
thing shall surely die: and he shall
restore the lamb fourfold, because he
did this thing, and because he had no
pity.</p>

<p>And Nathan said to David, Thou
art the man. Wherefore hast thou
despised the commandment of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to do evil in his sight? thou
hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the
sword, and hast taken his wife to be
thy wife, and hast slain him with the
sword of the children of Ammon.
Now therefore the sword shall never
depart from thine house. And David
said unto Nathan, I have sinned
against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Nathan said
unto David, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> also hath put
away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
Howbeit, because by this deed thou
hast given great occasion to the enemies
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to blaspheme, the
child also that is born unto thee shall
surely die.</p>

<p>And Nathan departed unto his
house. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> struck the
child that Uriah's wife bare unto
David, and it was very sick. David
therefore besought God for the child;
and David fasted, and went in, and
lay all night upon the earth. And the
elders of his house arose, and went
to him, to raise him up from the
earth: but he would not, neither did
he eat bread with them. And it came
to pass on the seventh day, that the
child died. And the servants of David
feared to tell him that the child
was dead: for they said, Behold,
while the child was yet alive, we spake
unto him, and he would not hearken
unto our voice: how will he then vex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
himself, if we tell him that the child
is dead? But when David saw that
his servants whispered, David perceived
that the child was dead: therefore
David said unto his servants, Is
the child dead? And they said, He
is dead. Then David arose from the
earth, and washed, and anointed
himself, and changed his apparel, and
came into the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
worshipped: then he came to his own
house; and when he required, they
set bread before him, and he did eat.
Then said his servants unto him,
What thing is this that thou hast
done? thou didst fast and weep for
the child, while it was alive; but when
the child was dead, thou didst rise and
eat bread. And he said, While the
child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
for I said, Who can tell whether <span class="smcap">God</span>
will be gracious to me, that the child
may live? But now he is dead, wherefore
should I fast? can I bring him
back again? I shall go to him, but he
shall not return to me.</p>

<p>And David comforted Bath-sheba
his wife: and she bare a son, and he
called his name Solomon: and the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> loved him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_92" id="CHAPTER_92">CHAPTER 92</a><br />

<small>THE REVOLT OF ABSALOM</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Samuel 13</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW Absalom, the king's son,
had slain his brother Amnon,
and had fled from his
father's face. And Absalom went to
Geshur, and was there three years.
And the soul of king David longed to
go forth unto him. And when Joab
perceived that the king's heart was
toward Absalom, he caused a woman
of Tekoah, by a parable, to incline
the king's heart to fetch home Absalom.
So Joab arose and went to Geshur,
and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
And the king said, Let him
turn to his own house, and let him
not see my face. So Absalom returned
to his own house. Now in all
Israel there was none to be so much
praised as Absalom for his beauty:
from the sole of his foot even to the
crown of his head there was no blemish
in him. And when he polled his
head, (for it was at every year's end
that he polled it: because the hair
was heavy on him, therefore he polled
it:) he weighed the hair of his head
at two hundred shekels after the
king's weight.</div>

<p>So Absalom dwelt two full years
in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's
face. Therefore Absalom sent for
Joab, to have sent him to the king;
but he would not come to him: and
when he sent again the second time,
he would not come. Therefore he
said unto his servants, See, Joab's
field is near mine, and he hath barley
there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's
servants set the field on fire.
Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom
unto his house, and said unto
him, Wherefore have thy servants set
my field on fire? And Absalom answered
Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee,
saying, Come hither, that I may send
thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am
I come from Geshur? it had been good
for me to have been there still: now
therefore let me see the king's face;
and if there be any iniquity in me,
let him kill me. So Joab came to the
king, and told him: and when he had
called for Absalom, he came to the
king, and bowed himself on his face to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the ground before the king: and the
king kissed Absalom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">II. Samuel 15</div>

<p>And it came to pass after this, that
Absalom prepared him chariots and
horses, and fifty men to run before
him. And Absalom rose up early,
and stood beside the way of the gate:
and it was so, that when any man that
had a controversy came to the king
for judgment, then Absalom called
unto him, and said, Of what city art
thou? And he said, Thy servant is
of one of the tribes of Israel. And
Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters
are good and right; but there is
no man deputed of the king to hear
thee. Absalom said moreover, Oh
that I were made judge in the land,
that every man which hath any suit
or cause might come unto me, and I
would do him justice! And it was
so, that when any man came nigh to
him to do him obeisance, he put forth
his hand, and took him, and kissed
him. And on this manner did Absalom
to all Israel that came to the king
for judgment: so Absalom stole the
hearts of the men of Israel.</p>

<p>And it came to pass after forty
years, that Absalom said unto the
king, I pray thee, let me go and pay
my vow, which I have vowed unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, in Hebron. For thy servant
vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur
in Syria, saying, If the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall
bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,
then I will serve the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the
king said unto him, Go in peace. So
he arose, and went to Hebron. But
Absalom sent spies throughout all the
tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye
hear the sound of the trumpet, then
ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
And with Absalom went two
hundred men out of Jerusalem, that
were called; and they went in their
simplicity, and they knew not any
thing. And Absalom sent for Ahithophel
the Gilonite, David's counsellor,
from his city, even from Giloh,
while he offered sacrifices. And the
conspiracy was strong; for the people
increased continually with Absalom.</p>

<p>And there came a messenger to David,
saying, The hearts of the men of
Israel are after Absalom. And David
said unto all his servants that were
with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let
us flee; for we shall not else escape
from Absalom: make speed to depart,
lest he overtake us suddenly,
and bring evil upon us, and smite the
city with the edge of the sword. And
the king's servants said unto the king,
Behold, thy servants are ready to do
whatsoever my lord the king shall
appoint. And the king went forth,
and all the people after him, and tarried
in a place that was far off. And
all the country wept with a loud
voice, and all the people passed over:
the king also himself passed over the
brook Kidron, and all the people
passed over, toward the way of the
wilderness. And lo Zadok also, and
all the Levites were with him, bearing
the ark of the covenant of God:
and they set down the ark of God; and
Abiathar went up, until all the people
had done passing out of the city.
And the king said unto Zadok, Carry
back the ark of God into the city: if
I shall find favour in the eyes of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, he will bring me again, and
shew me both it, and his habitation:
but if he thus say, I have no delight
in thee; behold, here am I, let him do
to me as seemeth good unto him. Zadok
therefore and Abiathar carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the ark of God again to Jerusalem:
and they tarried there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">II. Samuel 16</div>

<p>And David went up by the ascent
of mount Olivet, and wept as he went
up, and had his head covered, and he
went barefoot: and all the people that
was with him covered every man his
head, and they went up, weeping as
they went up. And one told David,
saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators
with Absalom. And David
said, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I pray thee, turn the
counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
And it came to pass, that when
David was come to the top of the
mount, where he worshipped God, behold,
Hushai the Archite came to
meet him with his coat rent and earth
upon his head: unto whom David
said, If thou passest on with me, then
thou shalt be a burden unto me: but if
thou return to the city, and say unto
Absalom, I will be thy servant, O
king; as I have been thy father's servant
hitherto, so will I now also be thy
servant: then mayest thou for me defeat
the counsel of Ahithophel. And
hast thou not there with thee Zadok
and Abiathar the priests? therefore
it shall be, that what thing soever
thou shalt hear out of the king's
house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and
Abiathar the priests. Behold, they
have there with them their two sons;
and by them ye shall send unto me
every thing that ye can hear. So
Hushai David's friend came into the
city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</p>

<p>And when king David came to Bahurim,
behold, thence came out a man
of the family of the house of Saul,
whose name was Shimei, the son of
Gera: he came forth, and cursed still
as he came. Then said Abishai the
son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why
should this dead dog curse my lord
the king? let me go over, I pray thee,
and take off his head. And the king
said, What have I to do with you, ye
sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath said unto him,
Curse David. Who shall then say,
Wherefore hast thou done so? And
David said to Abishai, and to all his
servants, Behold, my son seeketh my
life: how much more now may this
Benjamite do it? let him alone, and
let him curse; for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath bidden
him. It may be that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
will look on mine affliction, and that
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will requite me good for his
cursing this day. And as David and
his men went by the way, Shimei went
along on the hill's side over against
him, and cursed as he went, and threw
stones at him, and cast dust.</p>

<p>And Absalom, and all the people
the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,
and Ahithophel with him. And it
came to pass, when Hushai the Archite,
David's friend, was come unto
Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom,
God save the king, God save
the king. And Absalom said to Hushai,
Is this thy kindness to thy
friend? why wentest thou not with thy
friend? And Hushai said unto Absalom,
Nay; but whom the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
this people, and all the men of Israel,
choose, his will I be, and with him will
I abide. And again, whom should I
serve? should I not serve in the presence
of his son? as I have served in
thy father's presence, so will I be in
thy presence.</p>

<p>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel,
Give counsel among you what we
shall do. And the counsel of Ahithophel,
which he counselled in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
days, was as if a man had enquired
at the oracle of God: so was all the
counsel of Ahithophel both with David
and with Absalom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">II. Samuel 17</div>

<p>And Ahithophel said unto Absalom,
Let me now choose out twelve thousand
men, and I will arise and pursue
after David this night: and I will
come upon him while he is weary and
weak handed, and will make him
afraid: and all the people that are
with him shall flee; and I will smite
the king only: and I will bring back
all the people unto thee. And the
saying pleased Absalom well, and all
the elders of Israel.</p>

<p>Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai
the Archite also, and let us
hear likewise what he saith. And
when Hushai was come to Absalom,
Absalom spake unto him, saying,
Ahithophel hath spoken after this
manner: shall we do after his saying?
if not; speak thou. And Hushai said
unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel
hath given is not good at
this time. For, said Hushai, thou
knowest thy father and his men, that
they be mighty men, and they be
chafed in their minds, as a bear
robbed of her whelps in the field: and
thy father is a man of war, and will
not lodge with the people. Behold,
he is hid now in some pit, or in some
other place: and it will come to pass,
when some of them be overthrown at
the first, that whosoever heareth it
will say, There is a slaughter among
the people that follow Absalom. And
he also that is valiant, whose heart is
as the heart of a lion, shall utterly
melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy
father is a mighty man, and they
which be with him are valiant men.
Therefore I counsel that all Israel be
generally gathered unto thee, from
Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand
that is by the sea for multitude; and
that thou go to battle in thine own
person. So shall we come upon him
in some place where he shall be found,
and we will light upon him as the
dew falleth on the ground: and of
him and of all the men that are with
him there shall not be left so much as
one. Moreover, if he be gotten into
a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes
to that city, and we will draw it into
the river, until there be not one small
stone found there. And Absalom and
all the men of Israel said, The counsel
of Hushai the Archite is better than
the counsel of Ahithophel. For the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> had appointed to defeat the
good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> might bring evil
upon Absalom.</p>

<p>Then said Hushai unto Zadok and
to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus
did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and
the elders of Israel; and thus and
thus have I counselled. Now therefore
send quickly, and tell David, saying,
Lodge not this night in the plains
of the wilderness, but speedily pass
over; lest the king be swallowed up,
and all the people that are with him.
Now the sons of Zadok and Abiathar
stayed by En-rogel; for they might
not be seen to come into the city: and
a wench went and told them; and they
went and told king David. Nevertheless
a lad saw them, and told Absalom:
but they went both of them
away quickly, and came to a man's
house in Bahurim, which had a well
in his court; whither they went down.</p>

<p>And the woman took and spread a
covering over the well's mouth, and
spread ground corn thereon; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
thing was not known. And when Absalom's
servants came to the woman
to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz
and Jonathan? And the woman
said unto them, They be gone over
the brook of water. And when they
had sought and could not find them,
they returned to Jerusalem. And it
came to pass, after they were departed,
that they came up out of the
well, and went and told king David,
and said unto David, Arise, and pass
quickly over the water: for thus hath
Ahithophel counselled against you.
Then David arose, and all the people
that were with him, and they passed
over Jordan: by the morning light
there lacked not one of them that was
not gone over Jordan. And when
Ahithophel saw that his counsel was
not followed, he saddled his ass, and
arose, and gat him home to his house,
to his city, and put his household in
order, and hanged himself, and died,
and was buried in the sepulchre of
his father.</p>

<p>Then David came to Mahanaim.
And Absalom passed over Jordan, he
and all the men of Israel with him.
And Absalom made Amasa captain
of the host instead of Joab. So Israel
and Absalom pitched in the land
of Gilead.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_93" id="CHAPTER_93">CHAPTER 93</a><br />

<small>THE DEATH OF ABSALOM</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Samuel 18</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND David numbered the people
that were with him, and set
captains of thousands and
captains of hundreds over them. And
David sent forth a third part of the
people under the hand of Joab, and a
third part under the hand of Abishai
the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother,
and a third part under the hand of
Ittai the Gittite. And the king said
unto the people, I will surely go forth
with you myself also. But the people
answered, Thou shalt not go forth:
for if we flee away, they will not care
for us; neither if half of us die, will
they care for us: but now thou art
worth ten thousand of us: therefore
now it is better that thou succour us
out of the city.</div>

<p>And the king said unto them, What
seemeth you best I will do. And the
king stood by the gate side, and all
the people came out by hundreds and
by thousands. And the king commanded
Joab and Abishai and Ittai,
saying, Deal gently for my sake with
the young man, even with Absalom.
And all the people heard when the
king gave all the captains charge concerning
Absalom. So the people went
out into the field against Israel: and
the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
where the people of Israel were
slain before the servants of David,
and there was there a great slaughter
that day of twenty thousand men.
For the battle was there scattered
over the face of all the country: and
the wood devoured more people that
day than the sword devoured.</p>

<p>And Absalom met the servants of
David. And Absalom rode upon a
mule, and the mule went under the
thick boughs of a great oak, and his
head caught hold of the oak, and he
was taken up between the heaven and
the earth; and the mule that was under
him went away. And a certain
man saw it, and told Joab, and said,
Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an
oak. And Joab said unto the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that told him, And, behold, thou sawest
him, and why didst thou not smite
him there to the ground? and I would
have given thee ten shekels of silver,
and a girdle. And the man said unto
Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
shekels of silver in mine hand,
yet would I not put forth mine hand
against the king's son: for in our
hearing the king charged thee and
Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that
none touch the young man Absalom.
Otherwise I should have wrought
falsehood against mine own life: for
there is no matter hid from the king,
and thou thyself wouldest have set
thyself against me. Then said Joab,
I may not tarry thus with thee. And
he took three darts in his hand, and
thrust them through the heart of Absalom,
while he was yet alive in the
midst of the oak. And ten young
men that bare Joab's armour compassed
about and smote Absalom, and
slew him. And Joab blew the trumpet,
and the people returned from
pursuing after Israel: for Joab held
back the people. And they took Absalom,
and cast him into a great pit
in the wood, and laid a very great
heap of stones upon him: and all Israel
fled every one to his tent.</p>

<p>Then said Ahimaaz the son of
Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the
king tidings, how that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath
avenged him of his enemies. And
Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not
bear tidings this day, but thou shalt
bear tidings another day: but this
day thou shalt bear no tidings, because
the king's son is dead. Then
said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king
what thou hast seen. And Cushi
bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok
yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let
me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi.
And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou
run, my son, seeing that thou hast no
tidings ready? But howsoever, said
he, let me run. And he said unto
him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the
way of the plain, and overran Cushi.
And Ahimaaz called, and said unto
the king, All is well. And he fell
down to the earth upon his face before
the king, and said, Blessed be
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, which hath delivered
up the men that lifted up their
hand against my lord the king. And
the king said, Is the young man Absalom
safe? And Ahimaaz answered,
When Joab sent the king's servant,
and me thy servant, I saw a great
tumult, but I knew not what it was.
And the king said unto him, Turn
aside, and stand here. And he turned
aside, and stood still. And, behold,
Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings,
my lord the king: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath
avenged thee this day of all them that
rose up against thee. And the king
said unto Cushi, Is the young man
Absalom safe? And Cushi answered,
The enemies of my lord the king, and
all that rise against thee to do thee
hurt, be as that young man is. And
the king was much moved, and went
up to the chamber over the gate, and
wept: and as he went, thus he said,
O my son Absalom, my son, my son
Absalom! would God I had died for
thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p>

<div class="sidenote">II. Samuel 19</div>

<p>And it was told Joab, Behold, the
king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.
And the victory that day was
turned into mourning unto all the people:
for the people heard say that
day how the king was grieved for his
son. And the people gat them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
stealth that day into the city, as people
being ashamed steal away when
they flee in battle. But the king covered
his face, and the king cried with
a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O
Absalom, my son, my son! And Joab
came into the house to the king, and
said, Thou hast shamed this day the
faces of all thy servants, which have
saved thy life; in that thou lovest
thine enemies, and hatest thy friends.
For thou hast declared this day, that
thou regardest neither princes nor
servants: for I perceive, that if Absalom
had lived, and all we had died
this day, then it had pleased thee well.
Now therefore arise, go forth, and
speak comfortably unto thy servants:
for I swear by the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, if thou go
not forth, there will not tarry one
with thee this night: and that will be
worse unto thee than all the evil that
befell thee from thy youth until now.</p>

<p>Then the king arose, and sat in the
gate. And they told unto all the people,
saying, Behold, the king doth sit
in the gate. And all the people came
before the king: for Israel had fled
every man to his tent.</p>

<small>DAVID BROUGHT BACK TO
JERUSALEM</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND all the people were at strife
throughout all the tribes of
Israel, saying, The king saved
us out of the hand of our enemies,
and he delivered us out of the hand
of the Philistines; and now he is fled
out of the land for Absalom. And
Absalom, whom we anointed over us,
is dead in battle. Now therefore why
speak ye not a word of bringing the
king back?</div>

<p>And king David sent to Zadok and
to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak
unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why
are ye the last to bring the king back
to his house? seeing the speech of all
Israel is come to the king, even to his
house. Ye are my brethren, ye are
my bones and my flesh: wherefore
then are ye the last to bring back the
king? And he bowed the heart of all
the men of Judah, even as the heart
of one man; so that they sent this
word unto the king, Return thou, and
all thy servants. So the king returned,
and came to Jordan. And
Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet
the king, to conduct the king over
Jordan. And Shimei the son of Gera,
a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
hasted and came down with the men
of Judah to meet king David. And
there were a thousand men of Benjamin
with him, and Ziba the servant
of the house of Saul, and his fifteen
sons and his twenty servants with
him; and they went over Jordan before
the king. And there went over
a ferry boat to carry over the king's
household, and to do what he thought
good. And Shimei the son of Gera
fell down before the king, as he was
come over Jordan; and said unto the
king, Let not my lord impute iniquity
unto me, neither do thou remember
that which thy servant did perversely
the day that my lord the king went
out of Jerusalem, that the king should
take it to his heart. For thy servant
doth know that I have sinned: therefore,
behold, I am come the first this
day of all the house of Joseph to go
down to meet my lord the king. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered
and said, Shall not Shimei be put to
death for this, because he cursed the
<span class="smcap">Lord's</span> anointed? And David said,
What have I to do with you, ye sons
of Zeruiah, that ye should this day
be adversaries unto me? shall there
any man be put to death this day in
Israel? for do not I know that I am
this day king over Israel? Therefore
the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt
not die. And the king sware unto
him.</p>

<p>And David had many mighty men.
And Abishai the brother of Joab was
the chief among them. And when David
fought against the Philistines
three of the mighty men went down,
and came to David in the harvest
time unto the cave of Adullam: and
the troop of the Philistines pitched
in the valley of Rephaim. And David
was then in an hold, and the garrison
of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.
And David longed, and said,
Oh that one would give me drink of
the water of the well of Beth-lehem,
which is by the gate! And the three
mighty men brake through the host
of the Philistines, and drew water
out of the well of Beth-lehem, that
was by the gate, and took it, and
brought it to David: nevertheless he
would not drink thereof, but poured
it out unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_95" id="CHAPTER_95">CHAPTER 95</a><br />

<small>DAVID'S CHOICE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Samuel 24</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND again the anger of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
was kindled against Israel,
and he moved David against
them to say, Go, number Israel and
Judah. And Joab and the captains
of the host went out from the presence
of the king, to number the people
of Israel. So when they had gone
through all the land, they came to
Jerusalem at the end of nine months
and twenty days. And Joab gave up
the sum of the number of the people
unto the king: and there were in Israel
eight hundred thousand valiant
men that drew the sword; and the
men of Judah were five hundred
thousand men.</div>

<p>And David's heart smote him after
that he had numbered the people.
And David said unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I have
sinned greatly in that I have done:
and now, I beseech thee, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, take
away the iniquity of thy servant; for
I have done very foolishly. For when
David was up in the morning, the
word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came unto the prophet
Gad, David's seer, saying, Go
and say unto David, Thus saith the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I offer thee three things;
choose thee one of them, that I may
do it unto thee. So Gad came to David,
and told him, and said unto him,
Shall seven years of famine come
unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee
three months before thine enemies,
while they pursue thee? or that there
be three days' pestilence in thy land?
now advise, and see what answer I
shall return to him that sent me. And
David said unto Gad, I am in a great
strait: let us fall now into the hand of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; for his mercies are great:
and let me not fall into the hand of
man.</p>

<p>So the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> sent a pestilence upon
Israel from the morning even to the
time appointed: and there died of the
people from Dan even to Beer-sheba
seventy thousand men. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the angel stretched out his hand upon
Jerusalem to destroy it, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> repented
him of the evil, and said to
the angel that destroyed the people,
It is enough: stay now thine hand.
And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was by the
threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.
And David spake unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
when he saw the angel that smote the
people, and said, Lo, I have sinned,
and I have done wickedly: but these
sheep, what have they done? let thine
hand, I pray thee, be against me, and
against my father's house.</p>

<p>And Gad came that day to David,
and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in the threshingfloor
of Araunah the Jebusite. And David
went up as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded.
So the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was intreated for the
land, and the plague was stayed from
Israel.</p>

<small>SOLOMON ANOINTED KING</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 1</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-n.jpg" width="150" height="176" alt="N" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">NOW king David
was old and
stricken in years.
And Adonijah the
son of Haggith
exalted himself,
saying, I will be
king: and he prepared
him chariots
and horsemen, and fifty men to
run before him. And his father had
not displeased him at any time in saying,
Why hast thou done so? and he
also was a very goodly man; and his
mother bare him after Absalom. And
he conferred with Joab the son of
Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the
priest: and they following Adonijah
helped him. But Zadok the priest,
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
Nathan the prophet, and the mighty
men which belonged to David, were
not with Adonijah. And Adonijah
slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle
by the stone of Zoheleth, and called
all his brethren the king's sons, and
all the men of Judah the king's servants:
but Nathan the prophet, and
Benaiah, and the mighty men, and
Solomon his brother, he called not.</div>

<p>Wherefore Nathan spake unto
Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon,
saying, Hast thou not heard that
Adonijah the son of Haggith doth
reign, and David our lord knoweth it
not? Now therefore come, let me, I
pray thee, give thee counsel, that
thou mayest save thine own life, and
the life of thy son Solomon. Go and
get thee in unto king David, and say
unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O
king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying,
Assuredly Solomon thy son shall
reign after me, and he shall sit upon
my throne? why then doth Adonijah
reign? Behold, while thou yet talkest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
there with the king, I also will
come in after thee, and confirm thy
words.</p>

<p>And Bath-sheba went in unto the
king into the chamber, and spake
as Nathan had commanded her.
And, lo, while she yet talked with the
king, Nathan the prophet also came
in. And they told the king, saying,
Behold Nathan the prophet. And
when he was come in before the king,
he bowed himself before the king with
his face to the ground. And Nathan
said, My lord, O king, hast thou said,
Adonijah shall reign after me, and
he shall sit upon my throne? For he
is gone down this day, and hath slain
oxen and fat cattle and sheep in
abundance, and hath called all the
king's sons, and the captains of the
host, and Abiathar the priest; and,
behold, they eat and drink before him,
and say, God save king Adonijah.
But me, even me thy servant, and
Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son
of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon,
hath he not called. Is this thing
done by my lord the king, and thou
hast not shewed it unto thy servant,
who should sit on the throne of my
lord the king after him?</p>

<p>Then king David answered and
said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she
came into the king's presence, and
stood before the king. And the king
sware, and said, As the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> liveth,
that hath redeemed my soul out of
all distress, even as I sware unto thee
by the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel, saying,
Assuredly Solomon thy son shall
reign after me, and he shall sit upon
my throne in my stead; even so will
I certainly do this day. Then Bath-sheba
bowed with her face to the
earth, and did reverence to the king,
and said, Let my lord king David
live for ever.</p>

<p>And king David said, Call me Zadok
the priest, and Nathan the prophet,
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.
And they came before the king.
The king also said unto them, Take
with you the servants of your lord,
and cause Solomon my son to ride
upon mine own mule, and bring him
down to Gihon: and let Zadok the
priest and Nathan the prophet anoint
him there king over Israel: and blow
ye with the trumpet, and say, God
save king Solomon. Then ye shall
come up after him, that he may come
and sit upon my throne; for he shall
be king in my stead: and I have appointed
him to be ruler over Israel
and over Judah.</p>

<p>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
answered the king, and said, Amen:
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of my lord the king say
so too. As the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath been with
my lord the king, even so be he with
Solomon, and make his throne greater
than the throne of my lord king
David.</p>

<p>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan
the prophet, and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada, and the king's body-guard,
went down, and caused Solomon to
ride upon king David's mule, and
brought him to Gihon. And Zadok
the priest took an horn of oil out of
the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon.
And they blew the trumpet; and all
the people said, God save king Solomon.
And all the people came up after
him, and the people piped with
pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so
that the earth rent with the sound of
them.</p>

<p>And Adonijah and all the guests
that were with him heard it as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
had made an end of eating. And
when Joab heard the sound of the
trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this
noise of the city being in an uproar?
And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan
the son of Abiathar the priest
came: and Adonijah said unto him,
Come in; for thou art a valiant
man, and bringest good tidings. And
Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah,
Verily our lord king David
hath made Solomon king. And Zadok
the priest and Nathan the prophet
have anointed him king in Gihon:
and they are come up from
thence rejoicing, so that the city rang
again. This is the noise that ye have
heard. And also Solomon sitteth on
the throne of the kingdom. And
moreover the king's servants came to
bless our lord king David, saying,
God make the name of Solomon better
than thy name, and make his
throne greater than thy throne. And
the king bowed himself upon the bed.
And also thus said the king, Blessed
be the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel, which hath
given one to sit on my throne this day,
mine eyes even seeing it. And all the
guests that were with Adonijah were
afraid, and rose up, and went every
man his way.</p>

<p>And Adonijah feared because of
Solomon, and arose, and went, and
caught hold on the horns of the altar.
And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold,
Adonijah feareth king Solomon:
for, lo, he hath caught hold on
the horns of the altar, saying, Let
king Solomon swear unto me to day
that he will not slay his servant with
the sword. And Solomon said, If he
will shew himself a worthy man, there
shall not an hair of him fall to the
earth: but if wickedness shall be
found in him, he shall die. So king
Solomon sent, and they brought him
down from the altar. And he came
and bowed himself to king Solomon:
and Solomon said unto him, Go to
thine house.</p>

<small>DEATH OF KING DAVID</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 2</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW the days of David drew
nigh that he should die; and
he charged Solomon his son,
saying, I go the way of all the earth:
be thou strong therefore, and shew
thyself a man; and keep the charge
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, to walk in his
ways, to keep his statutes, and his
commandments, and his judgments,
and his testimonies, as it is written
in the law of Moses, that thou mayest
prosper in all that thou doest, and
whithersoever thou turnest thyself:
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> may continue his word
which he spake concerning me, saying,
If thy children take heed to their
way, to walk before me in truth with
all their heart and with all their soul,
there shall not fail thee (said he) a
man on the throne of Israel.</div>

<p>So David slept with his fathers,
and was buried in the city of David.
And the days that David reigned
over Israel were forty years: seven
years reigned he in Hebron, and
thirty and three years reigned he in
Jerusalem. Then sat Solomon upon
the throne of David his father; and
his kingdom was established greatly.
And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh
king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's
daughter, and brought her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
into the city of David, until he had
made an end of building his own
house, and the house of the LORD, and
the wall of Jerusalem round about.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_98" id="CHAPTER_98">CHAPTER 98</a><br />

<small>SOLOMON'S JUDGMENT</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 3</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Solomon loved the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
walking in the statutes of David
his father. And the king
went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for
that was the great high place: a thousand
burnt offerings did Solomon
offer upon that altar. In Gibeon the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared to Solomon in a dream
by night: and God said, Ask what I
shall give thee. And Solomon said,
Thou hast shewed unto thy servant
David my father great mercy, according
as he walked before thee in truth,
and in righteousness, and in uprightness
of heart with thee; and thou
hast kept for him this great kindness,
that thou hast given him a son to sit
on his throne, as it is this day. And
now, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my God, thou hast made
thy servant king instead of David my
father: and I am but a little child: I
know not how to go out or come in.
And thy servant is in the midst of
thy people which thou hast chosen,
a great people, that cannot be numbered
nor counted for multitude.
Give therefore thy servant an understanding
heart to judge thy people,
that I may discern between good and
bad: for who is able to judge this thy
so great a people? And the speech
pleased the Lord, that Solomon had
asked this thing. And God said unto
him, Because thou hast asked this
thing, and hast not asked for thyself
long life; neither hast asked riches
for thyself, nor hast asked the life of
thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself
understanding to discern judgment;
behold, I have done according
to thy words: lo, I have given thee a
wise and an understanding heart; so
that there was none like thee before
thee, neither after thee shall any arise
like unto thee. And I have also given
thee that which thou hast not asked,
both riches, and honour: so that there
shall not be any among the kings like
unto thee all thy days. And if thou
wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes
and my commandments, as thy
father David did walk, then I will
lengthen thy days.</div>

<p>And Solomon awoke; and, behold,
it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem,
and stood before the ark of
the covenant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and offered
up burnt offerings, and offered peace
offerings, and made a feast to all his
servants.</p>

<p>Then came there two women unto
the king, and stood before him. And
the one woman said, O my lord, I and
this woman dwell in one house; and I
was delivered of a child with her in
the house. And it came to pass the
third day after that I was delivered,
that this woman was delivered also:
and we were together; there was no
stranger with us in the house, save
we two in the house. And this woman's
child died in the night; because
she overlaid it. And she arose at
midnight, and took my son from beside
me, while thine handmaid slept,
and laid it in her bosom, and laid her
dead child in my bosom. And when
I rose in the morning to give my child
suck, behold, it was dead: but when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
had considered it in the morning, behold,
it was not my son, which I did
bear. And the other woman said,
Nay; but the living is my son, and the
dead is thy son. And this said, No;
but the dead is thy son, and the living
is my son. Thus they spake before
the king. Then said the king, The
one saith, This is my son that liveth,
and thy son is the dead: and the other
saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead,
and my son is the living. And the
king said, Bring me a sword. And
they brought a sword before the king.
And the king said, Divide the living
child in two, and give half to the one,
and half to the other. Then spake
the woman whose the living child was
unto the king, for her bowels yearned
upon her son, and she said, O my lord,
give her the living child, and in no
wise slay it. But the other said, Let
it be neither mine nor thine, but divide
it. Then the king answered and
said, Give her the living child, and in
no wise slay it: she is the mother
thereof. And all Israel heard of the
judgment which the king had judged;
and they feared the king: for they
saw that the wisdom of God was in
him, to do judgment.</p>

dwelt safely, every man under
his vine and under his fig tree, from
Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days

<p>And God gave Solomon wisdom
and understanding exceeding much,
and largeness of heart, even as the
sand that is on the sea shore. And
Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom
of all the children of the east
country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
For he was wiser than all men: and
his fame was in all nations round
about. And he spake three thousand
proverbs: and his songs were a thousand
and five. And he spake of trees,
from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
even unto the hyssop that springeth
out of the wall: he spake also of
beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping
things, and of fishes. And there came
of all people to hear the wisdom of
Solomon, from all kings of the earth,
which had heard of his wisdom.</p>

<small>THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 5</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Hiram king of Tyre sent
his servants unto Solomon;
for he had heard that they
had anointed him king in the room
of his father: for Hiram was ever a
lover of David. And Solomon sent
to Hiram, saying, Thou knowest how
that David my father could not build
an house unto the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
his God for the wars which were about
him on every side, until the LORD put
them under the soles of his feet. But
now the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my God hath given me
rest on every side, so that there is
neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
And, behold, I purpose to build an
house unto the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my
God, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto David
my father, saying, Thy son, whom I
will set upon thy throne in thy room,
he shall build an house unto my
name. Now therefore command thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
that they hew me cedar trees out of
Lebanon; and my servants shall be
with thy servants: and unto thee will
I give hire for thy servants according
to all that thou shalt appoint: for
thou knowest that there is not among
us any that can skill to hew timber
like unto the Sidonians.</div>

<p>And it came to pass, when Hiram
heard the words of Solomon, that he
rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> this day, which hath given
unto David a wise son over this great
people. And Hiram sent to Solomon,
saying, I have considered the things
which thou sentest to me for: and I
will do all thy desire concerning timber
of cedar, and concerning timber
of fir. My servants shall bring them
down from Lebanon unto the sea: and
I will convey them by sea in floats
unto the place that thou shalt appoint
me, and will cause them to be discharged
there, and thou shalt receive
them: and thou shalt accomplish my
desire, in giving food for my household.
So Hiram gave Solomon cedar
trees and fir trees according to all his
desire. And Solomon gave Hiram
twenty thousand measures of wheat
for food to his household, and twenty
measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon
to Hiram year by year. And
king Solomon raised a levy out of all
Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand
men. And he sent them to Lebanon,
ten thousand a month by
courses: a month they were in Lebanon,
and two months at home: and
Adoniram was over the levy.</p>

<p>And Solomon had threescore and
ten thousand that bare burdens, and
fourscore thousand hewers in the
mountains; beside the chief of Solomon's
officers which were over the
work, three thousand and three hundred,
which ruled over the people that
wrought in the work. And the king
commanded, and they brought great
stones, costly stones, and hewed
stones, to lay the foundation of the
house. And Solomon's builders and
Hiram's builders did hew them: so
they prepared timber and stones to
build the house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 6</div>

<p>And it came to pass in the four hundred
and eightieth year after the children
of Israel were come out of the
land of Egypt, in the fourth year of
Solomon's reign over Israel, in the
month Zif, which is the second month,
that he began to build the house of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the house, when it was
in building, was built of stone made
ready before it was brought thither:
so that there was neither hammer
nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in
the house, while it was in building.
So he built the house, and finished it;
and covered the house with beams
and boards of cedar. And the cedar
of the house within was carved with
knops and open flowers: all was cedar;
there was no stone seen. And
the oracle he prepared in the house
within, to set there the ark of the covenant
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the whole
house he overlaid with gold, until he
had finished all the house: also the
whole altar that was by the oracle he
overlaid with gold.</p>

<p>And within the oracle he made two
cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits
high. And he set the cherubims
within the inner house: and they
stretched forth the wings of the
cherubims, so that the wing of the one
touched the one wall, and the wing of
the other cherub touched the other
wall; and their wings touched one another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in the midst of the house. And
he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
And he carved all the walls of the
house round about with carved figures
of cherubims and palm trees and
open flowers, within and without.
And the floor of the house he overlaid
with gold, within and without. And
he built the inner court with three
rows of hewed stone, and a row of
cedar beams. In the fourth year was
the foundation of the house of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> laid, in the month Zif: and in
the eleventh year, in the month Bul,
which is the eighth month, was the
house finished throughout all the
parts thereof, and according to all
the fashion of it. So was he seven
years in building it.</p>

<p>And king Solomon sent and fetched
Hiram out of Tyre. He was a widow's
son of the tribe of Naphtali, and
his father was a man of Tyre, a
worker in brass: and he was filled
with wisdom, and understanding, and
cunning to work all works in brass.
And he came to king Solomon, and
wrought all his work. For he cast
two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits
high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits
did compass either of them about.
And he set up the pillars in the porch
of the temple. And he made a molten
sea. It stood upon twelve oxen,
three looking toward the north, and
three looking toward the west, and
three looking toward the south, and
three looking toward the east: and the
sea was set above upon them, and all
their hinder parts were inward. And
it was an hand breadth thick, and the
brim thereof was wrought like the
brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies:
it contained two thousand baths.
And Hiram made the lavers, and the
shovels, and the basons. In the plain
of Jordan did the king cast them, in
the clay ground between Succoth and
Zarthan.</p>

<p>And Solomon left all the vessels
unweighed, because they were exceeding
many: neither was the weight
of the brass found out. And Solomon
made all the vessels that pertained
unto the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: the altar
of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon
the shewbread was, and the
candlesticks of pure gold, five on the
right side, and five on the left, before
the oracle, with the flowers, and the
lamps, and the tongs of gold, and the
bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons,
and the spoons, and the censers
of pure gold; and the hinges of gold,
both for the doors of the inner house,
the most holy place, and for the doors
of the house, to wit, of the temple.
So was ended all the work that king
Solomon made for the house of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Solomon brought in the
things which David his father had
dedicated; even the silver, and the
gold, and the vessels, did he put
among the treasures of the house of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<small>THE DEDICATION OF THE
TEMPLE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 8</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THEN Solomon assembled the
elders of Israel, and all the
heads of the tribes, the chief
of the fathers of the children of Israel,
unto king Solomon in Jerusalem,
that they might bring up the ark of
the covenant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> out of the
city of David, which is Zion. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
all the men of Israel assembled themselves
unto king Solomon at the feast
in the month Ethanim, which is the
seventh month. And all the elders of
Israel came, and the priests took up
the ark. And they brought up the ark
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and the tabernacle of the
congregation, and all the holy vessels
that were in the tabernacle, even those
did the priests and the Levites bring
up. And king Solomon, and all the
congregation of Israel, that were assembled
unto him, were with him before
the ark, sacrificing sheep and
oxen, that could not be told nor
numbered for multitude. And the
priests brought in the ark of the
covenant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> unto his place,
into the oracle of the house, to
the most holy place, even under the
wings of the cherubims. For the
cherubims spread forth their two
wings over the place of the ark, and
the cherubims covered the ark and
the staves thereof above. There was
nothing in the ark save the two tables
of stone, which Moses put there at
Horeb, when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> made a covenant
with the children of Israel, when
they came out of the land of Egypt.
And it came to pass, when the priests
were come out of the holy place, that
the cloud filled the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
so that the priests could not stand to
minister because of the cloud: for
the glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had filled the
house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</div>

<p>Then spake Solomon, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
said that he would dwell in the thick
darkness. I have surely built thee an
house to dwell in, a settled place for
thee to abide in for ever. And the
king turned his face about, and
blessed all the congregation of Israel:
(and all the congregation of Israel
stood;) and he said, Blessed be the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel, which spake with
his mouth unto David my father, and
hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
Since the day that I brought forth
my people Israel out of Egypt, I
chose no city out of all the tribes of
Israel to build an house, that my
name might be therein; but I chose
David to be over my people Israel.
And it was in the heart of David my
father to build an house for the name
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto David my father,
Whereas it was in thine heart to build
an house unto my name, thou didst
well that it was in thine heart. Nevertheless
thou shalt not build the
house; but thy son that shall come
forth out of thy loins, he shall build
the house unto my name. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath performed his word that
he spake, and I am risen up in the
room of David my father, and sit on
the throne of Israel, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
promised, and have built an house for
the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel.
And I have set there a place for the
ark, wherein is the covenant of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, which he made with our fathers,
when he brought them out of
the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>And Solomon stood before the altar
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in the presence of all
the congregation of Israel, and spread
forth his hands toward heaven: and
he said, <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel, there is
no God like thee, in heaven above, or
on earth beneath, who keepest covenant
and mercy with thy servants that
walk before thee with all their heart:
who hast kept with thy servant David
my father that thou promisedst
him: thou spakest also with thy
mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
hand, as it is this day. But will God
indeed dwell on the earth? behold,
the heaven and heaven of heavens
cannot contain thee; how much less
this house that I have builded? Yet
have thou respect unto the prayer of
thy servant, and to his supplication,
O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my God, to hearken unto the
cry and to the prayer, which thy servant
prayeth before thee to day: that
thine eyes may be open toward this
house night and day, even toward the
place of which thou hast said, My
name shall be there: that thou mayest
hearken unto the prayer which thy
servant shall make toward this place.
And hearken thou to the supplication
of thy servant, and of thy people Israel,
when they shall pray toward this
place: and hear thou in heaven thy
dwelling place: and when thou hearest,
forgive.</p>

<p>If any man trespass against his
neighbour, and an oath be laid upon
him to cause him to swear, and the
oath come before thine altar in this
house: then hear thou in heaven, and
do, and judge thy servants, condemning
the wicked, to bring his way upon
his head; and justifying the righteous,
to give him according to his
righteousness.</p>

<p>When heaven is shut up, and there
is no rain, because they have sinned
against thee; if they pray toward this
place, and confess thy name, and turn
from their sin, when thou afflictest
them: then hear thou in heaven, and
forgive the sin of thy servants, and
of thy people Israel, that thou teach
them the good way wherein they
should walk, and give rain upon thy
land, which thou hast given to thy
people for an inheritance. If there be
in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
blasting, mildew, locust, or if
there be a caterpiller; if their enemy
besiege them in the land of their
cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever
sickness there be; what prayer and
supplication soever be made by any
man, or by all thy people Israel,
which shall know every man the
plague of his own heart, and spread
forth his hands toward this house:
then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling
place, and forgive, and do, and
give to every man according to his
ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for
thou, even thou only, knowest the
hearts of all the children of men;)
that they may fear thee all the days
that they live in the land which thou
gavest unto our fathers.</p>

<p>Moreover concerning a stranger,
that is not of thy people Israel, but
cometh out of a far country for thy
name's sake; (for they shall hear of
thy great name, and of thy strong
hand, and of thy stretched out arm;)
when he shall come and pray toward
this house; hear thou in heaven thy
dwelling place, and do according to
all that the stranger calleth to thee
for: that all people of the earth may
know thy name, to fear thee, as do
thy people Israel; and that they may
know that this house, which I have
builded, is called by thy name.</p>

<p>If thy people go out to battle
against their enemy, whithersoever
thou shalt send them, and shall pray
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> toward the city which
thou hast chosen, and toward the
house that I have built for thy name:
then hear thou in heaven their prayer
and their supplication, and maintain
their cause. If they sin against thee,
(for there is no man that sinneth not,)
and thou be angry with them, and deliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
them to the enemy, so that they
carry them away captives unto the
land of the enemy, far or near; yet
if they shall bethink themselves in the
land whither they were carried captives,
and repent, and make supplication
unto thee in the land of them
that carried them captives, saying,
We have sinned, and have done perversely,
we have committed wickedness;
and so return unto thee with
all their heart, and with all their
soul, in the land of their enemies,
which led them away captive, and
pray unto thee toward their land,
which thou gavest unto their fathers,
the city which thou hast chosen,
and the house which I have built
for thy name: then hear thou their
prayer and their supplication in
heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain
their cause, and forgive thy
people that have sinned against thee,
and all their transgressions wherein
they have transgressed against thee,
and give them compassion before
them who carried them captive, that
they may have compassion on them:
for they be thy people, and thine inheritance,
which thou broughtest
forth out of Egypt, from the midst of
the furnace of iron: that thine eyes
may be open unto the supplication of
thy servant, and unto the supplication
of thy people Israel, to hearken
unto them in all that they call for unto
thee. For thou didst separate them
from among all the people of the
earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou
spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant,
when thou broughtest our fathers
out of Egypt, O Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>Now therefore arise, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God,
into thy resting place, thou, and the
ark of thy strength: let thy priests,
O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God, be clothed with salvation,
and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.
O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God, turn not away the
face of thine anointed: remember the
mercies of David thy servant.</p>

<p>And it was so, that when Solomon
had made an end of praying all this
prayer and supplication unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, he arose from before the altar
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, from kneeling on his
knees with his hands spread up to
heaven. And he stood, and blessed
all the congregation of Israel with a
loud voice, saying, Blessed be the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that hath given rest unto his
people Israel, according to all that he
promised: there hath not failed one
word of all his good promise, which
he promised by the hand of Moses his
servant. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God be with
us, as he was with our fathers: let
him not leave us, nor forsake us: that
he may incline our hearts unto him,
to walk in all his ways, and to keep
his commandments, and his statutes,
and his judgments, which he commanded
our fathers. And let these
my words, wherewith I have made
supplication before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, be
nigh unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God day and
night, that he maintain the cause of
his servant, and the cause of his people
Israel at all times, as the matter
shall require: that all the people of
the earth may know that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is
God, and that there is none else. Let
your heart therefore be perfect with
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God, to walk in his statutes,
and to keep his commandments,
as at this day.</p>

<p>Now when Solomon had made an
end of praying, the fire came down
from heaven, and consumed the burnt
offering and the sacrifices; and the
glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> filled the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
And the priests could not enter into
the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, because the
glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had filled the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>
house. And when all the children of
Israel saw how the fire came down,
and the glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> upon the
house, they bowed themselves with
their faces to the ground upon the
pavement, and worshipped, and
praised the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, saying, For he is
good; for his mercy endureth for
ever.</p>

<p>Then the king and all the people
offered sacrifices before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
And king Solomon offered a sacrifice
of twenty and two thousand oxen,
and an hundred and twenty thousand
sheep: so the king and all the people
dedicated the house of God.</p>

<small>THE QUEEN OF SHEBA</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 10</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND when the queen of Sheba
heard of the fame of Solomon
concerning the name of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, she came to prove him with
hard questions. And she came to Jerusalem
with a very great train, with
camels that bare spices, and very
much gold, and precious stones: and
when she was come to Solomon, she
communed with him of all that was
in her heart. And Solomon told her
all her questions: there was not any
thing hid from the king, which he told
her not. And when the queen of
Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom,
and the house that he had built,
and the meat of his table, and the
sitting of his servants, and the attendance
of his ministers, and their apparel,
and his cupbearers, and his
ascent by which he went up unto the
house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; there was no more
spirit in her. And she said to the
king, It was a true report that I heard
in mine own land of thy acts and of
thy wisdom. Howbeit I believed not
the words, until I came, and mine
eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half
was not told me: thy wisdom and
prosperity exceedeth the fame which
I heard. Happy are thy men, happy
are these thy servants, which stand
continually before thee, and that hear
thy wisdom. Blessed be the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy
God, which delighted in thee, to set
thee on the throne of Israel: because
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> loved Israel for ever, therefore
made he thee king, to do judgment
and justice. And she gave the
king an hundred and twenty talents
of gold, and of spices very great store,
and precious stones: there came no
more such abundance of spices as
these which the queen of Sheba gave
to king Solomon.</div>

<p>And king Solomon gave unto the
queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever
she asked, beside that which Solomon
gave her of his royal bounty.
So she turned and went to her own
country, she and her servants.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_102" id="CHAPTER_102">CHAPTER 102</a><br />

<small>SOLOMON'S RICHES&mdash;HE FORSAKES
THE LORD</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>NOW the weight of gold that
came to Solomon in one year
was six hundred threescore
and six talents of gold, beside that he
had of the merchantmen, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
traffick of the spice merchants, and of
all the kings of Arabia, and of the
governors of the country. And king
Solomon made two hundred targets
of beaten gold: six hundred shekels
of gold went to one target. And he
made three hundred shields of beaten
gold; three pound of gold went to one
shield: and the king put them in the
house of the forest of Lebanon. Moreover
the king made a great throne of
ivory, and overlaid it with the best
gold. The throne had six steps, and
the top of the throne was round behind:
and there were stays on either
side on the place of the seat, and two
lions stood beside the stays. And
twelve lions stood there on the one
side and on the other upon the six
steps: there was not the like made in
any kingdom. And all king Solomon's
drinking vessels were of gold,
and all the vessels of the house of the
forest of Lebanon were of pure gold;
none were of silver: it was nothing
accounted of in the days of Solomon.
For the king had at sea a navy of
Tharshish with the navy of Hiram:
once in three years came the navy of
Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver,
ivory, and apes, and peacocks. So
king Solomon exceeded all the kings
of the earth for riches and for wisdom.</div>

<p>And all the earth sought to Solomon,
to hear his wisdom, which God
had put in his heart. And they
brought every man his present, vessels
of silver, and vessels of gold, and
garments, and armour, and spices,
horses, and mules, a rate year by
year. And Solomon gathered together
chariots and horsemen: and
he had a thousand and four hundred
chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen,
whom he bestowed in the cities
for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
And the king made silver
to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars
made he to be as the sycomore
trees that are in the vale, for abundance.
And Solomon had horses
brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
the king's merchants received the
linen yarn at a price.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 11</div>

<p>But king Solomon loved many
strange women, together with the
daughter of Pharaoh, women of the
Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians,
and Hittites. For it came
to pass, when Solomon was old, that
his wives turned away his heart after
other gods: and his heart was not perfect
with the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God, as was the
heart of David his father. And Solomon
did evil in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and went not fully after the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, as
did David his father.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was angry with Solomon,
because his heart was turned
from the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel, which
had appeared unto him twice, and had
commanded him concerning this
thing, that he should not go after
other gods: but he kept not that which
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded. Wherefore
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Solomon, Forasmuch
as this is done of thee, and thou
hast not kept my covenant and my
statutes, which I have commanded
thee, I will surely rend the kingdom
from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
Notwithstanding in thy days
I will not do it for David thy father's
sake: but I will rend it out of the hand
of thy son. Howbeit I will not rend
away all the kingdom; but will give
one tribe to thy son for David my
servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's
sake which I have chosen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> stirred up adversaries
against Solomon. And Jeroboam
the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of
Zereda, Solomon's servant, even he
lifted up his hand against the king.
And the man Jeroboam was a mighty
man of valour: and Solomon seeing
the young man that he was industrious,
he made him ruler over all the
charge of the house of Joseph. And
it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam
went out of Jerusalem, that the
prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found
him in the way; and he had clad himself
with a new garment; and they
two were alone in the field: and Ahijah
caught the new garment that was
on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:
and he said to Jeroboam, Take thee
ten pieces: for thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend
the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon,
and will give ten tribes to thee.
Howbeit I will not take the whole
kingdom out of his hand: but I will
make him prince all the days of his
life for David my servant's sake,
whom I chose, because he kept my
commandments and my statutes: but I
will take the kingdom out of his son's
hand, and will give it unto thee, even
ten tribes. And unto his son will I
give one tribe, that David my servant
may have a light alway before me
in Jerusalem, the city which I have
chosen me to put my name there. And
I will take thee, and thou shalt reign
according to all that thy soul desireth,
and shalt be king over Israel. And
it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto
all that I command thee, and wilt
walk in my ways, and do that is right
in my sight, to keep my statutes and
my commandments, as David my servant
did; that I will be with thee, and
build thee a sure house, as I built for
David, and will give Israel unto thee.
And I will for this afflict the seed of
David, but not for ever.</p>

<p>Solomon sought therefore to kill
Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and
fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of
Egypt, and was in Egypt until the
death of Solomon.</p>

<p>And the time that Solomon reigned
in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty
years. And Solomon slept with his
fathers, and was buried in the city of
David his father: and Rehoboam his
son reigned in his stead.</p>

<small>REHOBOAM&mdash;THE REVOLT OF THE TEN TRIBES</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 12</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="150" height="173" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">AND Rehoboam
went to Shechem:
for all Israel
were come to
Shechem to make
him king. And
it came to pass,
when Jeroboam
the son of Nebat,
who was yet in Egypt, heard of it,
(for he was fled from the presence of
king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt
in Egypt;) that they sent and called
him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation
of Israel came, and spake
unto Rehoboam, saying, Thy father
made our yoke grievous: now therefore
make thou the grievous service
of thy father, and his heavy yoke
which he put upon us, lighter, and we
will serve thee. And he said unto
them, Depart yet for three days, then
come again to me. And the people
departed.</div>

<p>And king Rehoboam consulted
with the old men, that stood before
Solomon his father while he yet
lived, and said, How do ye advise
that I may answer this people? And
they spake unto him, saying, If
thou wilt be a servant unto this people
this day, and wilt serve them, and
answer them, and speak good words
to them, then they will be thy servants
for ever. But he forsook the
counsel of the old men, which they
had given him, and consulted with
the young men that were grown up
with him, and which stood before
him: and he said unto them, What
counsel give ye that we may answer
this people, who have spoken
to me, saying, Make the yoke which
thy father did put upon us lighter?
And the young men that were grown
up with him spake unto him, saying,
Thus shalt thou speak unto this people
that spake unto thee, saying, Thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
father made our yoke heavy, but make
thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou
say unto them, My little finger shall
be thicker than my father's loins.
And now whereas my father did lade
you with a heavy yoke, I will add to
your yoke: my father hath chastised
you with whips, but I will chastise
you with scorpions.</p>

<p>So Jeroboam and all the people
came to Rehoboam the third day, as
the king had appointed, saying, Come
to me again the third day. And the
king answered the people roughly,
and forsook the old men's counsel
that they gave him; and spake to
them after the counsel of the young
men, saying, My father made your
yoke heavy, and I will add to your
yoke: my father also chastised you
with whips, but I will chastise you
with scorpions. Wherefore the king
hearkened not unto the people; for
the cause was from the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that he
might perform his saying, which the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake by Ahijah the Shilonite
unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>

<p>So when all Israel saw that the king
hearkened not unto them, the people
answered the king, saying, What
portion have we in David? neither
have we inheritance in the son of
Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see
to thine own house, David. So Israel
departed unto their tents.</p>

<p>But as for the children of Israel
which dwelt in the cities of Judah,
Rehoboam reigned over them. Then
king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who
was over the tribute; and all Israel
stoned him with stones, that he died.
Therefore king Rehoboam made
speed to get him up to his chariot, to
flee to Jerusalem. So Israel rebelled
against the house of David unto this
day. And it came to pass, when all
Israel heard that Jeroboam was come
again, that they sent and called him
unto the congregation, and made him
king over all Israel: there was none
that followed the house of David, but
the tribe of Judah only.</p>

<p>And when Rehoboam was come to
Jerusalem, he assembled all the house
of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin,
an hundred and fourscore thousand
chosen men, which were warriors, to
fight against the house of Israel, to
bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam
the son of Solomon. But the word of
God came unto Shemaiah the man of
God, saying, Speak unto Rehoboam,
the son of Solomon, king of Judah,
and unto all the house of Judah and
Benjamin, and to the remnant of the
people, saying, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
your brethren the children of Israel:
return every man to his house; for
this thing is from me. They hearkened
therefore to the word of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and returned to depart, according
to the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in
mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein;
and went out from thence, and built
Penuel. And Jeroboam said in his
heart, Now shall the kingdom return
to the house of David: if this people
go up to do sacrifice in the house of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> at Jerusalem, then shall the
heart of this people turn again unto
their lord, even unto Rehoboam king
of Judah, and they shall kill me, and
go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.
Whereupon the king took counsel,
and made two calves of gold, and said
unto them, It is too much for you to
go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods,
O Israel, which brought thee up out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of the land of Egypt. And he set the
one in Beth-el, and the other put he
in Dan. And this thing became a
sin: for the people went to worship
before the one, even unto Dan. And
he made an house of high places, and
made priests of the lowest of the people,
which were not of the sons of
Levi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 14</div>

<p>At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam
fell sick. And Jeroboam said
to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and
disguise thyself, that thou be not
known to be the wife of Jeroboam;
and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there
is Ahijah the prophet, which told me
that I should be king over this people.
And take with thee ten loaves, and
cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and
go to him: he shall tell thee what shall
become of the child. And Jeroboam's
wife did so, and arose, and went to
Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah.
But Ahijah could not see; for
his eyes were set by reason of his age.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Ahijah,
Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh
to ask a thing of thee for her son; for
he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou
say unto her: for it shall be, when she
cometh in, that she shall feign herself
to be another woman. And it was so,
when Ahijah heard the sound of her
feet, as she came in at the door, that
he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam;
why feignest thou thyself to
be another? for I am sent to thee with
heavy tidings. Go, tell Jeroboam,
Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel,
Forasmuch as I exalted thee from
among the people, and made thee
prince over my people Israel, and
rent the kingdom away from the
house of David, and gave it thee: and
yet thou hast not been as my servant
David, who kept my commandments,
and who followed me with all his
heart, to do that only which was right
in mine eyes; but hast done evil above
all that were before thee: for thou
hast gone and made thee other gods,
and molten images, to provoke me to
anger, and hast cast me behind thy
back: therefore, behold, I will bring
evil upon the house of Jeroboam.
Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the
city shall the dogs eat; and him that
dieth in the field shall the fowls of
the air eat: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath spoken
it. Arise thou therefore, get thee to
thine own house: and when thy feet
enter into the city, the child shall die.
And all Israel shall mourn for him,
and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam
shall come to the grave, because
in him there is found some good thing
toward the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel in the
house of Jeroboam. Moreover the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall raise him up a king over
Israel, who shall cut off the house of
Jeroboam that day: but what? even
now. For the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall smite Israel,
as a reed is shaken in the water, and
he shall root up Israel out of this good
land, which he gave to their fathers,
and shall scatter them beyond the
river, because they have made their
groves, provoking the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to anger.
And he shall give Israel up because
of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin,
and who made Israel to sin.</p>

<p>And Jeroboam's wife arose, and
departed, and came to Tirzah: and
when she came to the threshold of the
door, the child died; and they buried
him; and all Israel mourned for him,
according to the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
which he spake by the hand of his servant
Ahijah the prophet. And the
days which Jeroboam reigned were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
two and twenty years: and he slept
with his fathers, and Nadab his son
reigned in his stead.</p>

<small>THREE KINGS OF JUDAH</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND Rehoboam the son of Solomon
reigned in Judah. Rehoboam
was forty and one years
old when he began to reign, and he
reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem,
the city which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> did
choose out of all the tribes of Israel,
to put his name there. And Judah
did evil in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
they provoked him to jealousy with
their sins which they had committed,
above all that their fathers had done.</div>

<p>And it came to pass in the fifth
year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak
king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
and he took away the treasures
of the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and the
treasures of the king's house; he even
took away all: and he took away all
the shields of gold which Solomon
had made. And there was war between
Rehoboam and Jeroboam all
their days. And Rehoboam slept
with his fathers, and was buried with
his fathers in the city of David. And
Abijam his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 15</div>

<p>Now in the eighteenth year of king
Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned
Abijam over Judah. Three years
reigned he in Jerusalem. And he
walked in all the sins of his father,
which he had done before him: and
his heart was not perfect with the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God, as the heart of David
his father. Nevertheless for David's
sake did the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God give him a
lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son
after him, and to establish Jerusalem:
because David did that which was
right in the eyes of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
turned not aside from any thing that
he commanded him all the days of his
life, save only in the matter of Uriah
the Hittite. And Abijam slept with
his fathers; and they buried him in
the city of David: and Asa his son
reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam
king of Israel reigned Asa
over Judah. And forty and one
years reigned he in Jerusalem. And
Asa did that which was good and
right in the eyes of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God:
for he took away the altars of the
strange gods, and the high places,
and brake down the images, and cut
down the groves: and commanded
Judah to seek the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of their
fathers, and to do the law and the
commandment. Also he took away
out of all the cities of Judah the high
places and the images: and the kingdom
was quiet before him. And he
built fenced cities in Judah: for the
land had rest, and he had no war in
those years; because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had
given him rest.</p>

<p>In the six and thirtieth year of the
reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel
came up against Judah, and built Ramah,
to the intent that he might let
none go out or come in to Asa king of
Judah. Then Asa brought out silver
and gold out of the treasures of the
house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and of the king's
house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of
Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
There is a league between me and
thee, as there was between my father
and thy father: behold, I have sent
thee silver and gold; go, break thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
league with Baasha king of Israel,
that he may depart from me. And
Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa,
and sent the captains of his armies
against the cities of Israel; and they
smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim,
and all the store cities of Naphtali.
And it came to pass, when Baasha
heard it, that he left off building of
Ramah, and let his work cease. Then
Asa the king took all Judah; and they
carried away the stones of Ramah,
and the timber thereof, wherewith
Baasha was building; and he built
therewith Geba and Mizpah. And
Asa slept with his fathers, and was
buried with his fathers in the city of
David his father: and Jehoshaphat
his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_105" id="CHAPTER_105">CHAPTER 105</a><br />

<small>THE WICKED KINGS OF ISRAEL</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND Nadab the son of Jeroboam
began to reign over Israel in
the second year of Asa king
of Judah, and reigned over Israel two
years. And he did evil in the sight
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and walked in the way of
his father, and in his sin wherewith
he made Israel to sin. And Baasha
the son of Ahijah conspired against
him, and smote him, and reigned in
his stead. And it came to pass, when
he reigned, that he smote all the house
of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam
any that breathed, until he had destroyed
him, according unto the saying
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, which he spake by his
servant Ahijah the Shilonite. In the
third year of Asa king of Judah began
Baasha the son of Ahijah to
reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty
and four years. And he did evil in
the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and walked in
the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin
wherewith he made Israel to sin.
Then the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came to
Jehu the son of Hanani against
Baasha, saying, Forasmuch as I exalted
thee out of the dust, and made
thee prince over my people Israel;
and thou hast walked in the way of
Jeroboam, and hast made my people
Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger
with their sins; behold, I will take
away the posterity of Baasha, and
the posterity of his house; and will
make thy house like the house of Jeroboam
the son of Nebat. So Baasha
slept with his fathers, and was buried
in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned
in his stead. And his servant Zimri,
captain of half his chariots, conspired
against him, as he was in Tirzah,
drinking himself drunk in the
house of Arza steward of his house
in Tirzah. And Zimri went in and
smote him, and killed him, in the
twenty and seventh year of Asa king
of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
And it came to pass, when he began
to reign, as soon as he sat on his
throne, that he slew all the house of
Baasha.</div>

<p>And the people were encamped
against Gibbethon, which belonged to
the Philistines. And the people that
were encamped heard say, Zimri hath
conspired, and hath also slain the
king: wherefore all Israel made
Omri, the captain of the host, king
over Israel that day in the camp.
And Omri went up from Gibbethon,
and all Israel with him, and they besieged
Tirzah. And it came to pass,
when Zimri saw that the city was
taken, that he went into the palace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the king's house, and burnt the king's
house over him with fire, and died.
Then were the people of Israel divided
into two parts: half of the people
followed Tibni the son of Ginath,
to make him king; and half followed
Omri. But the people that followed
Omri prevailed against the people
that followed Tibni the son of Ginath:
so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. But
Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and did worse than all that were
before him. So Omri slept with his
fathers, and was buried in Samaria:
and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>And in the thirty and eighth year
of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the
son of Omri to reign over Israel: and
Ahab reigned over Israel in Samaria
twenty and two years. And Ahab
did evil in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> above
all that were before him. And it
came to pass, as if it had been a light
thing for him to walk in the sins of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he
took to wife Jezebel the daughter of
Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and
went and served Baal, and worshipped
him. And he reared up an
altar for Baal in the house of Baal,
which he had built in Samaria. And
Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did
more to provoke the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel
to anger than all the kings of
Israel that were before him.</p>

<small>ELIJAH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 17</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Elijah the Tishbite, who
was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
said unto Ahab, As the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel liveth, before
whom I stand, there shall not be dew
nor rain these years, but according
to my word. And the word of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> came unto him, saying, Get thee
hence, and turn thee eastward, and
hide thyself by the brook Cherith,
that is before Jordan. And it shall
be, that thou shalt drink of the brook;
and I have commanded the ravens to
feed thee there. So he went and did
according unto the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>:
for he went and dwelt by the brook
Cherith, that is before Jordan. And
the ravens brought him bread and
flesh in the morning, and bread and
flesh in the evening; and he drank of
the brook. And it came to pass after
a while, that the brook dried up, because
there had been no rain in the
land.</div>

<p>And the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came
unto him, saying, Arise, get thee to
Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon,
and dwell there: behold, I have commanded
a widow woman there to sustain
thee. So he arose and went to
Zarephath. And when he came to the
gate of the city, behold, the widow
woman was there gathering of sticks:
and he called to her, and said, Fetch
me, I pray thee, a little water in a
vessel, that I may drink. And as she
was going to fetch it, he called to her,
and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a
morsel of bread in thine hand. And
she said, As the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God liveth,
I have not a cake, but an handful of
meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a
cruse: and, behold, I am gathering
two sticks, that I may go in and dress
it for me and my son, that we may eat
it, and die. And Elijah said unto
her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast
said: but make me thereof a little
cake first, and bring it unto me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
after make for thee and for thy son.
For thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel,
The barrel of meal shall not waste,
neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until
the day that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> sendeth rain
upon the earth. And she went and
did according to the saying of Elijah:
and she, and he, and her house, did
eat many days. And the barrel of
meal wasted not, neither did the cruse
of oil fail, according to the word of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, which he spake by Elijah.
And it came to pass after these things,
that the son of the woman, the mistress
of the house, fell sick; and his
sickness was so sore, that there was
no breath left in him. And she said
unto Elijah, What have I to do with
thee, O thou man of God? art thou
come unto me to call my sin to remembrance,
and to slay my son? And he
said unto her, Give me thy son. And
he took him out of her bosom, and
carried him up into a loft, where he
abode, and laid him upon his own
bed. And he cried unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
said, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my God, hast thou also
brought evil upon the widow with
whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
And he stretched himself upon the
child three times, and cried unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my God, I
pray thee, let this child's soul come
into him again. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> heard
the voice of Elijah; and the soul of
the child came into him again, and he
revived. And Elijah took the child,
and brought him down out of the
chamber into the house, and delivered
him unto his mother: and Elijah said,
See, thy son liveth. And the woman
said to Elijah, Now by this I know
that thou art a man of God, and that
the word of the LORD in thy mouth is
truth.</p>

<small>ELIJAH AND THE PROPHETS
OF BAAL</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 18</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass after many
days, that the word of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> came to Elijah in the
third year, saying, Go, shew thyself
unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon
the earth. And Elijah went to shew
himself unto Ahab. And there was a
sore famine in Samaria. And Ahab
called Obadiah, which was the governor
of his house. (Now Obadiah
feared the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> greatly: for it was
so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that Obadiah took an
hundred prophets, and hid them by
fifty in a cave, and fed them with
bread and water.) And Ahab said
unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto
all fountains of water, and unto all
brooks: peradventure we may find
grass to save the horses and mules
alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
So they divided the land between
them to pass throughout it: Ahab
went one way by himself, and Obadiah
went another way by himself.</div>

<p>And as Obadiah was in the way,
behold, Elijah met him: and he knew
him, and fell on his face, and said,
Art thou that my lord Elijah? And
he answered him, I am: go, tell thy
lord, Behold, Elijah is here. And he
said, What have I sinned, that thou
wouldest deliver thy servant into the
hand of Ahab, to slay me? As the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God liveth, there is no nation
or kingdom, whither my lord
hath not sent to seek thee: and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
they said, He is not there; he took an
oath of the kingdom and nation, that
they found thee not. And now thou
sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah
is here. And it shall come to pass,
as soon as I am gone from thee, that
the Spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall carry thee
whither I know not; and so when I
come and tell Ahab, and he cannot
find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy
servant fear the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> from my youth.
Was it not told my lord what I did
when Jezebel slew the prophets of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, how I hid an hundred men of
the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> prophets by fifty in a cave,
and fed them with bread and water?
And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy
lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he
shall slay me. And Elijah said, As
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts liveth, before whom
I stand, I will surely shew myself
unto him to day. So Obadiah went
to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab
went to meet Elijah.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Ahab
saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him,
Art thou he that troubleth Israel?
And he answered, I have not troubled
Israel; but thou, and thy father's
house, in that ye have forsaken the
commandments of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and thou
hast followed Baalim. Now therefore
send, and gather to me all Israel
unto mount Carmel, and the prophets
of Baal four hundred and fifty, and
the prophets of the groves four hundred,
which eat at Jezebel's table. So
Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel,
and gathered the prophets together
unto mount Carmel. And Elijah
came unto all the people, and
said, How long halt ye between two
opinions? if the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> be God, follow
him: but if Baal, then follow him.
And the people answered him not a
word. Then said Elijah unto the
people, I, even I only, remain a prophet
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; but Baal's prophets
are four hundred and fifty men. Let
them therefore give us two bullocks;
and let them choose one bullock
for themselves, and cut it in
pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no
fire under: and I will dress the other
bullock, and lay it on wood, and put
no fire under: and call ye on the name
of your gods, and I will call on the
name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and the God that
answereth by fire, let him be God.
And all the people answered and said,
It is well spoken. And Elijah said
unto the prophets of Baal, Choose
you one bullock for yourselves, and
dress it first; for ye are many; and
call on the name of your gods, but put
no fire under. And they took the bullock
which was given them, and they
dressed it, and called on the name of
Baal from morning even until noon,
saying, O Baal, hear us. But there
was no voice, nor any that answered.
And they leaped upon the altar which
was made. And it came to pass at
noon, that Elijah mocked them, and
said, Cry aloud: for he is a god;
either he is talking, or he is pursuing,
or he is in a journey, or peradventure
he sleepeth, and must be
awaked. And they cried aloud, and
cut themselves after their manner
with knives and lancets, till the blood
gushed out upon them. And it came
to pass, when midday was past, and
they prophesied until the time of the
offering of the evening sacrifice, that
there was neither voice, nor any to
answer, nor any that regarded.</p>

<p>And Elijah said unto all the people,
Come near unto me. And all the
people came near unto him. And he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
repaired the altar of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that
was broken down. And Elijah took
twelve stones, according to the number
of the tribes of the sons of Jacob,
unto whom the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
came, saying, Israel shall be thy
name: and with the stones he built an
altar in the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and he
made a trench about the altar, as
great as would contain two measures
of seed. And he put the wood in
order, and cut the bullock in pieces,
and laid him on the wood, and said,
Fill four barrels with water, and
pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on
the wood. And he said, Do it the
second time. And they did it the second
time. And he said, Do it the
third time. And they did it the
third time. And the water ran round
about the altar; and he filled the
trench also with water.</p>

<p>And it came to pass at the time of
the offering of the evening sacrifice,
that Elijah the prophet came near,
and said, <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Abraham,
Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known
this day that thou art God in Israel,
and that I am thy servant, and that I
have done all these things at thy
word. Hear me, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, hear me,
that this people may know that thou
art the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God, and that thou hast
turned their heart back again. Then
the fire of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> fell, and consumed
the burnt sacrifice, and the
wood, and the stones, and the dust,
and licked up the water that was in
the trench. And when all the people
saw it, they fell on their faces: and
they said, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, he is the God;
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, he is the God. And Elijah
said unto them, Take the prophets of
Baal; let not one of them escape.
And they took them: and Elijah
brought them down to the brook
Kishon, and slew them there.</p>

<p>And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get
thee up, eat and drink; for there is a
sound of abundance of rain. So Ahab
went up to eat and to drink. And
Elijah went up to the top of Carmel;
and he cast himself down upon the
earth, and put his face between his
knees, and said to his servant, Go up
now, look toward the sea. And he
went up, and looked, and said, There
is nothing. And he said, Go again
seven times. And it came to pass at
the seventh time, that he said, Behold,
there ariseth a little cloud out
of the sea, like a man's hand. And he
said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare
thy chariot, and get thee down, that
the rain stop thee not. And it came
to pass in the mean while, that the
heaven was black with clouds and
wind, and there was a great rain.
And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
And the hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was on Elijah;
and he girded up his loins, and
ran before Ahab to the entrance of
Jezreel.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Ahab told Jezebel all that
Elijah had done, and withal
how he had slain all the prophets
with the sword. Then Jezebel
sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying,
So let the gods do to me, and more
also, if I make not thy life as the life
of one of them by to morrow about
this time.</div>

<p>And when he saw that, he arose,
and went for his life, and came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah,
and left his servant there. But
he himself went a day's journey into
the wilderness, and came and sat
down under a juniper tree: and he
requested for himself that he might
die; and said, It is enough; now, O
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, take away my life; for I am not
better than my fathers. And as he
lay and slept under a juniper tree,
behold, then an angel touched him,
and said unto him, Arise and eat.
And he looked, and, behold, there was
a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse
of water at his head. And he did
eat and drink, and laid him down
again. And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
came again the second time, and
touched him, and said, Arise and eat;
because the journey is too great for
thee. And he arose, and did eat and
drink, and went in the strength of
that meat forty days and forty nights
unto Horeb the mount of God.</p>

<p>And he came thither unto a cave,
and lodged there; and, behold, the
word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came to him, and he
said unto him, What doest thou here,
Elijah? And he said, I have been
very jealous for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of
hosts: for the children of Israel have
forsaken thy covenant, thrown down
thine altars, and slain thy prophets
with the sword; and I, even I only,
am left; and they seek my life, to take
it away. And he said, Go forth, and
stand upon the mount before the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And, behold, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> passed
by, and a great and strong wind rent
the mountains, and brake in pieces
the rocks before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; but the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> was not in the wind: and after
the wind an earthquake; but the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
was not in the earthquake: and after
the earthquake a fire; but the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
was not in the fire: and after the fire
a still small voice. And it was so,
when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped
his face in his mantle, and went out,
and stood in the entering in of the
cave. And, behold, there came a
voice unto him, and said, What doest
thou here, Elijah? And he said, I
have been very jealous for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
God of hosts: because the children of
Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
thrown down thine altars, and slain
thy prophets with the sword; and I,
even I only, am left; and they seek
my life, to take it away. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto him, Go, return on
thy way to the wilderness of Damascus:
and when thou comest, anoint
Hazael to be king over Syria: and
Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou
anoint to be king over Israel: and
Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah
shalt thou anoint to be prophet
in thy room. And it shall come
to pass, that him that escapeth the
sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and
him that escapeth from the sword of
Jehu shall Elisha slay. Yet I have
left me seven thousand in Israel, all
the knees which have not bowed unto
Baal, and every mouth which hath
not kissed him.</p>

<p>So he departed thence, and found
Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was
plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before
him, and he with the twelfth:
and Elijah passed by him, and cast
his mantle upon him. And he left
the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and
said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father
and my mother, and then I will
follow thee. And he said unto him,
Go back again: for what have I done
to thee? And he returned back from
him, and took a yoke of oxen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
slew them, and boiled their flesh with
the instruments of the oxen, and gave
unto the people, and they did eat.
Then he arose, and went after Elijah,
and ministered unto him.</p>

<small>SIEGE OF SAMARIA</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 20</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Ben-hadad the king of Syria
gathered all his host together:
and there were thirty and two
kings with him, and horses, and chariots:
and he went up and besieged Samaria,
and warred against it. And
he sent messengers to Ahab king of
Israel into the city, and said unto him,
Thus saith Ben-hadad, thy silver and
thy gold is mine; thy wives also and
thy children, even the goodliest, are
mine. And the king of Israel answered
and said, My lord, O king, according
to thy saying, I am thine,
and all that I have. And the messengers
came again, and said, Thus
speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although
I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou
shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy
gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
yet I will send my servants unto thee
to morrow about this time, and they
shall search thine house, and the
houses of thy servants; and it shall
be, that whatsoever is pleasant in
thine eyes, they shall put it in their
hand, and take it away. Then the
king of Israel called all the elders of
the land, and said, Mark, I pray you,
and see how this man seeketh mischief:
for he sent unto me for my
wives, and for my children, and for
my silver, and for my gold; and I denied
him not. And all the elders and
all the people said unto him, Hearken
not unto him, nor consent. Wherefore
he said unto the messengers of
Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All
that thou didst send for to thy servant
at the first I will do: but this
thing I may not do. And the messengers
departed, and brought him word
again. And Ben-hadad sent unto
him, and said, The gods do so unto
me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria
shall suffice for handfuls for
all the people that follow me. And
the king of Israel answered and said,
Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on
his harness boast himself as he that
putteth it off. And it came to pass,
when Ben-hadad heard this message,
as he was drinking, he and the kings
in the pavilions, that he said unto his
servants, Set yourselves in array.
And they set themselves in array
against the city.</div>

<p>And, behold, there came a prophet
unto Ahab king of Israel, saying,
Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Hast thou seen
all this great multitude? behold, I will
deliver it into thine hand this day;
and thou shalt know that I am the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Ahab said, By whom?
And he said, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
Even by the young men of the princes
of the provinces. Then he said, Who
shall order the battle? And he answered,
Thou. Then he numbered
the young men of the princes of the
provinces, and they were two hundred
and thirty two: and after them
he numbered all the people, even
all the children of Israel, being
seven thousand. So these young
men of the princes of the provinces
came out of the city, and the army
which followed them. And they slew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
every one his man: and the Syrians
fled; and Israel pursued them: and
Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped
on an horse with the horsemen. And
the king of Israel went out, and smote
the horses and chariots, and slew the
Syrians with a great slaughter.</p>

<p>And the prophet came to the king
of Israel, and said unto him, Go,
strengthen thyself, and mark, and see
what thou doest: for at the return of
the year the king of Syria will come
up against thee. And it came to pass
at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad
numbered the Syrians, and
went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
And the children of Israel were
numbered, and were all present, and
went against them. And they pitched
one over against the other seven days.
And so it was, that in the seventh
day the battle was joined: and the
children of Israel slew of the Syrians
an hundred thousand footmen in one
day.</p>

<p>And Ben-hadad's servants said
unto him, Behold now, we have heard
that the kings of the house of Israel
are merciful kings: let us, I pray
thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and
ropes upon our heads, and go out to
the king of Israel: peradventure he
will save thy life. So they girded
sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes
on their heads, and came to the king
of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad
saith, I pray thee, let me live.
And he said, Is he yet alive? Go ye,
bring him. Then Ben-hadad came
forth to him; and he caused him to
come up into the chariot. And Ben-hadad
said unto him, The cities,
which my father took from thy father,
I will restore; and thou shalt make
streets for thee in Damascus, as my
father made in Samaria. Then said
Ahab, I will send thee away with this
covenant. So he made a covenant
with him, and sent him away.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> sent a prophet unto
the king of Israel. And he said unto
him, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Because
thou hast let go out of thy hand a man
whom I appointed to utter destruction,
therefore thy life shall go for
his life, and thy people for his people.
And the king of Israel went to his
house heavy and displeased, and
came to Samaria.</p>

<small>NABOTH'S VINEYARD</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 21</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass after these
things, that Naboth the Jezreelite
had a vineyard, which
was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of
Ahab king of Samaria. And Ahab
spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me
thy vineyard, that I may have it for
a garden of herbs, because it is near
unto my house: and I will give thee
for it a better vineyard than it; or,
if it seem good to thee, I will give thee
the worth of it in money. And Naboth
said to Ahab, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> forbid
it me, that I should give the inheritance
of my fathers unto thee. And
Ahab came into his house heavy and
displeased because of the word which
Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to
him: for he had said, I will not give
thee the inheritance of my fathers.
And he laid him down upon his bed,
and turned away his face, and would
eat no bread.</div>

<p>But Jezebel his wife came to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and said unto him, Why is thy spirit
so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
And he said unto her, Because I spake
unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said
unto him, Give me thy vineyard for
money; or else, if it please thee, I will
give thee another vineyard for it: and
he answered, I will not give thee my
vineyard. And Jezebel his wife said
unto him, Dost thou now govern the
kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat
bread, and let thine heart be merry:
I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth
the Jezreelite. So she wrote letters
in Ahab's name, and sealed them
with his seal, and sent the letters unto
the elders and to the nobles that were
in his city, dwelling with Naboth, saying,
Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth
on high among the people: and set
two men, sons of Belial, before him,
to bear witness against him, saying,
Thou didst blaspheme God and the
king. And then carry him out, and
stone him, that he may die.</p>

<p>And the men of his city, even the
elders and the nobles who were the
inhabitants in his city, did as it was
written in the letters which she had
sent unto them. They proclaimed a
fast, and set Naboth on high among
the people.</p>

<p>And there came in two men, children
of Belial, and sat before him:
and the men of Belial witnessed
against him, even against Naboth, in
the presence of the people, saying,
Naboth did blaspheme God and the
king. Then they carried him forth
out of the city, and stoned him with
stones, that he died. Then they sent
to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned,
and is dead. And it came to pass,
when Jezebel heard that Naboth was
stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel
said to Ahab, Arise, take possession
of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
which he refused to give thee
for money: for Naboth is not alive,
but dead. And it came to pass, when
Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,
that Ahab rose up to go down to the
vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to
take possession of it.</p>

<p>And the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came to
Elijah the Tishbite, saying, Arise, go
down to meet Ahab king of Israel,
which is in Samaria: behold, he is in
the vineyard of Naboth, whither he
is gone down to possess it. And thou
shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus
saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Hast thou killed, and
also taken possession? Thus saith the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, In the place where dogs licked
the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick
thy blood, even thine. And Ahab
said to Elijah, Hast thou found me,
O mine enemy? And he answered, I
have found thee: because thou hast
sold thyself to work evil in the sight
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Behold, I will bring
evil upon thee, and will take away
thy posterity, and will make thine
house like the house of Jeroboam the
son of Nebat, and like the house of
Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the
provocation wherewith thou hast provoked
me to anger, and made Israel
to sin. And of Jezebel also spake
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, saying, The dogs shall eat
Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. Him
that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs
shall eat; and him that dieth in the
field shall the fowls of the air eat.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Ahab
heard those words, that he rent his
clothes, and put sackcloth upon his
flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth,
and went softly. And the word of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> came to Elijah the Tishbite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
saying, Seest thou how Ahab humbleth

humbleth himself before me, I will

<small>JEHOSHAPHAT, KING OF JUDAH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Kings 22</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND they continued three years
without war between Syria
and Israel. And it came to
pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat
the king of Judah came down to
the king of Israel. And the king of
Israel said unto his servants, Know
ye that Ramoth in Gilead is our's,
and we be still, and take it not out of
the hand of the king of Syria? And
he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou
go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead?
And Jehoshaphat said to the
king of Israel, I am as thou art, my
people as thy people, my horses as
thy horses.</div>

<p>And Jehoshaphat said unto the
king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee,
at the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to day. Then
the king of Israel gathered the prophets
together, about four hundred
men, and said unto them, Shall I go
against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or
shall I forbear? And they said, Go
up; for the Lord shall deliver it into
the hand of the king. And Jehoshaphat
said, Is there not here a prophet
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> besides, that we might
enquire of him? And the king of Israel
said unto Jehoshaphat, There is
yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah,
by whom we may enquire of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>: but I hate him; for he doth not
prophesy good concerning me, but
evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not
the king say so. Then the king of
Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten
hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.
So he came to the king. And the king
said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go
against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or
shall we forbear? And he answered
him, Go, and prosper: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shall deliver it into the hand of the
king. And the king said unto him,
How many times shall I adjure thee
that thou tell me nothing but that
which is true in the name of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>? And he said, I saw all Israel
scattered upon the hills, as sheep that
have not a shepherd: and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
said, These have no master: let them
return every man to his house in
peace. And the king of Israel said
unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee
that he would prophesy no good concerning
me, but evil? And the king
of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and
carry him back unto Amon the governor
of the city, and to Joash the
king's son; and say, Thus saith the
king, Put this fellow in the prison,
and feed him with bread of affliction
and with water of affliction, until I
come in peace. And Micaiah said, If
thou return at all in peace, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
hath not spoken by me. And he said,
Hearken, O people, every one of you.</p>

<p>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat
the king of Judah went up to
Ramoth-gilead. And the king of Israel
said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
myself, and enter into the battle;
but put thou on thy robes. And
the king of Israel disguised himself,
and went into the battle. But the
king of Syria commanded his thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and two captains that had rule over
his chariots, saying, Fight neither
with small nor great, save only with
the king of Israel. And it came to
pass, when the captains of the chariots
saw Jehoshaphat, that they said,
Surely it is the king of Israel. And
they turned aside to fight against
him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
And it came to pass, when the captains
of the chariots perceived that
it was not the king of Israel, that they
turned back from pursuing him.
And a certain man drew a bow at a
venture, and smote the king of Israel
between the joints of the harness:
wherefore he said unto the driver of
his chariot, Turn thine hand, and
carry me out of the host; for I am
wounded. And the battle increased
that day: and the king was stayed up
in his chariot against the Syrians, and
died at even: and the blood ran out
of the wound into the midst of the
chariot. And there went a proclamation
throughout the host about the going
down of the sun, saying, Every
man to his city, and every man to his
own country. So the king died, and
was brought to Samaria; and they
buried the king in Samaria. And one
washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria;
and the dogs licked up his
blood; according unto the word of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> which he spake. So Ahab slept
with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son
reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began
to reign over Judah in the fourth
year of Ahab king of Israel. Jehoshaphat
was thirty and five years old
when he began to reign; and he
reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem.
And he walked in all the
ways of Asa his father; he turned not
aside from it, doing that which was
right in the eyes of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers,
and was buried with his fathers in the
city of David: and Jehoram his son
reigned in his stead.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>AHAZIAH the son of Ahab began
to reign over Israel in
Samaria the seventeenth year
of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and
reigned two years over Israel. And
he did evil in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and walked in the way of his father,
and in the way of his mother, and in
the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
who made Israel to sin: for he
served Baal, and worshipped him,
and provoked to anger the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God
of Israel, according to all that his father
had done.</div>

<p>Then Moab rebelled against Israel
after the death of Ahab.</p>

<p>And Ahaziah fell down through a
lattice in his upper chamber that was
in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent
messengers, and said unto them, Go,
enquire of Baal-zebub the god of
Ekron whether I shall recover of this
disease. But the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go
up to meet the messengers of the king
of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it
not because there is not a God in Israel,

not come down from that bed on

<small>ELIJAH TAKEN UP TO HEAVEN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 2</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, when the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> would take up Elijah
into heaven by a whirlwind,
that Elijah went with Elisha from
Gilgal. And fifty men of the sons of
the prophets went, and stood to view
afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.
And Elijah took his mantle,
and wrapped it together, and smote
the waters, and they were divided
hither and thither, so that they two
went over on dry ground.</div>

<p>And it came to pass, when they
were gone over, that Elijah said unto
Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee,
before I be taken away from thee.
And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a
double portion of thy spirit be upon
me. And he said, Thou hast asked
a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see
me when I am taken from thee, it
shall be so unto thee; but if not, it
shall not be so. And it came to pass,
as they still went on, and talked, that,
behold, there appeared a chariot of
fire, and horses of fire, and parted
them both asunder; and Elijah went
up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>

<p>And Elisha saw it, and he cried,
My father, my father, the chariot of
Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
And he saw him no more: and he took
hold of his own clothes, and rent them
in two pieces. He took up also the
mantle of Elijah that fell from him,
and went back, and stood by the bank
of Jordan; and he took the mantle of
Elijah that fell from him, and smote
the waters, and said, Where is the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Elijah? and when he
also had smitten the waters, they
parted hither and thither: and Elisha
went over. And when the sons of the
prophets which were to view at Jericho
saw him, they said, The spirit of
Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they
came to meet him, and bowed themselves
to the ground before him. And
they said unto him, Behold now, there
be with thy servants fifty strong men;
let them go, we pray thee, and seek
thy master: lest peradventure the
Spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath taken him up,
and cast him upon some mountain, or
into some valley. And he said, Ye
shall not send. And when they urged
him till he was ashamed, he said,
Send. They sent therefore fifty men;
and they sought three days, but
found him not. And when they came
again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,)
he said unto them, Did I not
say unto you, Go not?</p>

<p>And the men of the city said unto
Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation
of this city is pleasant, as my
lord seeth: but the water is naught,
and the ground barren. And he said,
Bring me a new cruse, and put salt
therein. And they brought it to him.
And he went forth unto the spring
of the waters, and cast the salt in
there, and said, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
I have healed these waters; there
shall not be from thence any more
death or barren land. So the waters
were healed unto this day, according
to the saying of Elisha which he
spake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>And he went up from thence unto
Beth-el: and as he was going up by
the way, there came forth little children
out of the city, and mocked him,
and said unto him, Go up, thou bald
head; go up, thou bald head. And he
turned back, and looked on them, and
cursed them in the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
And there came forth two she bears
out of the wood, and tare forty and
two children of them. And he went
from thence to mount Carmel, and
from thence he returned to Samaria.</p>

<small>WAR WITH THE MOABITES</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 3</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW Jehoram the son of Ahab
began to reign over Israel in
Samaria the eighteenth year
of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and
reigned twelve years. And he
wrought evil in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>;
but not like his father, and like his
mother: for he put away the image
of Baal that his father had made.
Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which
made Israel to sin; he departed not
therefrom.</div>

<p>And Mesha king of Moab was a
sheepmaster, and rendered unto the
king of Israel an hundred thousand
lambs, and an hundred thousand
rams, with the wool. But it came to
pass, when Ahab was dead, that the
king of Moab rebelled against the
king of Israel.</p>

<p>And king Jehoram went out of Samaria
the same time, and numbered
all Israel. And he went and sent to
Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying,
The king of Moab hath rebelled
against me: wilt thou go with me
against Moab to battle? And he said,
I will go up: I am as thou art, my people
as thy people, and my horses as
thy horses. And he said, Which way
shall we go up? And he answered,
The way through the wilderness of
Edom. So the king of Israel went,
and the king of Judah, and the king
of Edom: and they fetched a compass
of seven days' journey: and there
was no water for the host, and for the
cattle that followed them. And the
king of Israel said, Alas! that the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath called these three kings together,
to deliver them into the hand
of Moab! But Jehoshaphat said, Is
there not here a prophet of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
that we may enquire of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> by
him? And one of the king of Israel's
servants answered and said, Here is
Elisha the son of Shaphat, which
poured water on the hands of Elijah.
And Jehoshaphat said, The word of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is with him. So the king of
Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king
of Edom went down to him. And
Elisha said unto the king of Israel,
What have I to do with thee? get thee
to the prophets of thy father, and to
the prophets of thy mother. And the
king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath called these three kings
together, to deliver them into the
hand of Moab. And Elisha said, As
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts liveth, before
whom I stand, surely, were it not that
I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat
the king of Judah, I would not look
toward thee, nor see thee. But now
bring me a minstrel. And it came to
pass, when the minstrel played, that
the hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came upon him.
And he said, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Make this valley full of ditches. For
thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Ye shall not see
wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet
that valley shall be filled with water,
that ye may drink, both ye, and your
cattle, and your beasts. And this is
but a light thing in the sight of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>: he will deliver the Moabites
also into your hand. And ye shall
smite every fenced city, and every
choice city, and shall fell every good
tree, and stop all wells of water, and
mar every good piece of land with
stones. And it came to pass in the
morning, when the meat offering was
offered, that, behold, there came water
by the way of Edom, and the
country was filled with water.</p>

<p>And when all the Moabites heard
that the kings were come up to fight
against them, they gathered all that
were able to put on armour, and upward,
and stood in the border. And
they rose up early in the morning,
and the sun shone upon the water,
and the Moabites saw the water on
the other side as red as blood: and
they said, This is blood: the kings are
surely slain, and they have smitten
one another: now therefore, Moab, to
the spoil. And when they came to
the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose
up and smote the Moabites, so that
they fled before them: but they went
forward smiting the Moabites, even
in their country. And they beat
down the cities, and on every good
piece of land cast every man his
stone, and filled it; and they stopped
all the wells of water, and felled all
the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth
left they the stones thereof; howbeit
the slingers went about it, and
smote it.</p>

<p>And when the king of Moab saw
that the battle was too sore for him,
he took with him seven hundred men
that drew swords, to break through
even unto the king of Edom: but they
could not. Then he took his eldest
son that should have reigned in his
stead, and offered him for a burnt offering
upon the wall. And there was
great indignation against Israel: and
they departed from him, and returned
to their own land.</p>

<small>THE WIDOW'S OIL&mdash;THE
SHUNAMMITE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 4</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW there cried a certain woman
of the wives of the sons
of the prophets unto Elisha,
saying, Thy servant my husband is
dead; and thou knowest that thy servant
did fear the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and the creditor
is come to take unto him my two
sons to be bondmen. And Elisha
said unto her, What shall I do for
thee? tell me, what hast thou in the
house? And she said, Thine handmaid
hath not any thing in the house,
save a pot of oil. Then he said, Go,
borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow
not a few. And when thou art
come in, thou shalt shut the door upon
thee and upon thy sons, and shalt
pour out into all those vessels, and
thou shalt set aside that which is full.
So she went from him, and shut the
door upon her and upon her sons, who
brought the vessels to her; and she
poured out. And it came to pass,
when the vessels were full, that she
said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
And he said unto her, There is
not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
Then she came and told the man of
God. And he said, Go, sell the oil,
and pay thy debt, and live thou and
thy children of the rest.</div>

<p>And it fell on a day, that Elisha
passed to Shunem, where was a great
woman; and she constrained him to
eat bread. And so it was, that as oft
as he passed by, he turned in thither
to eat bread. And she said unto her
husband, Behold now, I perceive that
this is an holy man of God, which
passeth by us continually. Let us
make a little chamber, I pray thee, on
the wall; and let us set for him there
a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a
candlestick: and it shall be, when he
cometh to us, that he shall turn in
thither. And it fell on a day, that he
came thither, and he turned into the
chamber, and lay there. And he said
to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite.
And when he had called
her, she stood before him. And he
said unto him, Say now unto her,
Behold, thou hast been careful for us
with all this care; what is to be done
for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for
to the king, or to the captain of the
host? And she answered, I dwell
among mine own people. And he
said, What then is to be done for her?
And Gehazi answered, Verily she
hath no child, and her husband is old.
And he said, Call her. And when he
had called her, she stood in the door.
And he said, About this season, according
to the time of life, thou shalt
embrace a son. And she said, Nay,
my lord, thou man of God, do not lie
unto thine handmaid. And the woman
bare a son at that season that
Elisha had said unto her.</p>

<p>And when the child was grown, it
fell on a day, that he went out to his
father to the reapers. And he said
unto his father, My head, my head.
And he said to a lad, Carry him to
his mother. And when he had taken
him, and brought him to his mother,
he sat on her knees till noon, and then
died. And she went up, and laid him
on the bed of the man of God, and
shut the door upon him, and went out.
And she called unto her husband, and
said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the
young men, and one of the asses, that
I may run to the man of God, and
come again. And he said, Wherefore
wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither
new moon, nor sabbath. And she
said, It shall be well. Then she saddled
an ass, and said to her servant,
Drive, and go forward; slack not thy
riding for me, except I bid thee. So
she went and came unto the man of
God to mount Carmel. And it came
to pass, when the man of God saw her
afar off, that he said to Gehazi his
servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:
run now, I pray thee, to
meet her, and say unto her, Is it well
with thee? is it well with thy husband?
is it well with the child? And
she answered, It is well.</p>

<p>And when she came to the man of
God to the hill, she caught him by the
feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust
her away. And the man of God said,
Let her alone; for her soul is vexed
within her: and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath hid it
from me, and hath not told me. Then
she said, Did I desire a son of my
lord? did I not say, Do not deceive
me?</p>

<p>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up
thy loins, and take my staff in thine
hand, and go thy way: if thou meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
any man, salute him not; and if any
salute thee, answer him not again:
and lay my staff upon the face of the
child. And the mother of the child
said, As the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> liveth, and as thy
soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And
he arose, and followed her. And Gehazi
passed on before them, and laid
the staff upon the face of the child;
but there was neither voice, nor hearing.
Wherefore he went again to
meet him, and told him, saying, The
child is not awaked. And when Elisha
was come into the house, behold,
the child was dead, and laid upon his
bed. He went in therefore, and shut
the door upon them twain, and prayed
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And he went up, and
lay upon the child, and put his mouth
upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his
eyes, and his hands upon his hands:
and he stretched himself upon the
child; and the flesh of the child waxed
warm. Then he returned, and walked
in the house to and fro; and went up,
and stretched himself upon him: and
the child sneezed seven times, and
the child opened his eyes. And he
called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite.
So he called her. And
when she was come in unto him, he
said, Take up thy son. Then she went
in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself
to the ground, and took up her
son, and went out.</p>

<small>NAAMAN HEALED&mdash;THE IRON
SWIMS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 5</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW Naaman, captain of the
host of the king of Syria, was
a great man with his master,
and honourable, because by him the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> had given deliverance unto
Syria: he was also a mighty man in
valour, but he was a leper. And the
Syrians had gone out by companies,
and had brought away captive out of
the land of Israel a little maid; and
she waited on Naaman's wife. And
she said unto her mistress, Would
God my lord were with the prophet
that is in Samaria! for he would recover
him of his leprosy. And one
went in, and told his lord, saying,
Thus and thus said the maid that is
of the land of Israel. And the king
of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will
send a letter unto the king of Israel.
And he departed, and took with him
ten talents of silver, and six thousand
pieces of gold, and ten changes of
raiment. And he brought the letter
to the king of Israel, saying, Now
when this letter is come unto thee, behold,
I have therewith sent Naaman
my servant to thee, that thou mayest
recover him of his leprosy. And it
came to pass, when the king of Israel
had read the letter, that he rent his
clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill
and to make alive, that this man doth
send unto me to recover a man of his
leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray
you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel
against me.</div>

<p>And it was so, when Elisha the man
of God had heard that the king of Israel
had rent his clothes, that he sent
to the king, saying, Wherefore hast
thou rent thy clothes? let him come
now to me, and he shall know that
there is a prophet in Israel. So Naaman
came with his horses and with
his chariot, and stood at the door of
the house of Elisha. And Elisha
sent a messenger unto him, saying,
Go and wash in Jordan seven times,
and thy flesh shall come again to thee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and thou shalt be clean. But Naaman
was wroth, and went away, and said,
Behold, I thought, He will surely
come out to me, and stand, and call
on the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God, and
strike his hand over the place, and recover
the leper. Are not Abana and
Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better
than all the waters of Israel? may I
not wash in them, and be clean? So
he turned and went away in a rage.
And his servants came near, and
spake unto him, and said, My father,
if the prophet had bid thee do some
great thing, wouldest thou not have
done it? how much rather then, when
he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
Then went he down, and dipped himself
seven times in Jordan, according
to the saying of the man of God: and
his flesh came again like unto the
flesh of a little child, and he was
clean.</p>

<p>And he returned to the man of God,
he and all his company, and came,
and stood before him: and he said,
Behold, now I know that there is no
God in all the earth, but in Israel:
now therefore, I pray thee, take a
blessing of thy servant. But he said,
As the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> liveth, before whom I
stand, I will receive none. And he
urged him to take it; but he refused.
And Naaman said, Shall there not
then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant
two mules' burden of earth? for
thy servant will henceforth offer neither
burnt offering nor sacrifice unto
other gods, but unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. In
this thing the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> pardon thy servant,
that when my master goeth into
the house of Rimmon to worship
there, and he leaneth on my hand, and
I bow myself in the house of Rimmon,
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> pardon thy servant in this
thing. And he said unto him, Go in
peace. So he departed from him a
little way.</p>

<p>But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha
the man of God, said, Behold, my
master hath spared Naaman this Syrian,
in not receiving at his hands
that which he brought: but, as the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> liveth, I will run after him, and
take somewhat of him. So Gehazi followed
after Naaman. And when
Naaman saw him running after him,
he lighted down from the chariot to
meet him, and said, Is all well? And
he said, All is well. My master hath
sent me, saying, Behold, even now
there be come to me from mount
Ephraim two young men of the sons
of the prophets: give them, I pray
thee, a talent of silver, and two
changes of garments. And Naaman
said, Be content, take two talents.
And he urged him, and bound two
talents of silver in two bags, with two
changes of garments, and laid them
upon two of his servants; and they
bare them before him. And when he
came to the tower, he took them from
their hand, and bestowed them in the
house: and he let the men go, and
they departed. But he went in, and
stood before his master. And Elisha
said unto him, Whence comest thou,
Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant
went no whither. And he said unto
him, Went not mine heart with thee,
when the man turned again from his
chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to
receive money, and to receive garments,
and oliveyards, and vineyards,
and sheep, and oxen, and menservants,
and maidservants? The leprosy
therefore of Naaman shall cleave
unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever.
And he went out from his presence a
leper as white as snow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 6</div>

<p>And the sons of the prophets said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
unto Elisha, Behold now, the place
where we dwell with thee is too strait
for us. Let us go, we pray thee, unto
Jordan, and take thence every man a
beam, and let us make us a place
there, where we may dwell. And he
answered, Go ye. And one said, Be
content, I pray thee, and go with thy
servants. And he answered, I will
go. So he went with them. And
when they came to Jordan, they cut
down wood. But as one was felling
a beam, the ax head fell into the water:
and he cried, and said, Alas, master!
for it was borrowed. And the
man of God said, Where fell it? And
he shewed him the place. And he cut
down a stick, and cast it in thither;
and the iron did swim. Therefore
said he, Take it up to thee. And he
put out his hand, and took it.</p>

<small>BEN-HADAD, KING OF SYRIA,
MAKES WAR ON ISRAEL</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 6</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THEN the king of Syria warred
against Israel, and took counsel
with his servants, saying,
In such and such a place shall be my
camp. And the man of God sent
unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware
that thou pass not such a place;
for thither the Syrians are come
down. And the king of Israel sent
to the place which the man of God
told him and warned him of, and
saved himself there, not once nor
twice. Therefore the heart of the
king of Syria was sore troubled for
this thing; and he called his servants,
and said unto them, Will ye not shew
me which of us is for the king of Israel?
And one of his servants said,
None, my lord, O king: but Elisha,
the prophet that is in Israel, telleth
the king of Israel the words that thou
speakest in thy bedchamber.</div>

<p>And he said, Go and spy where he
is, that I may send and fetch him.
And it was told him, saying, Behold,
he is in Dothan. Therefore sent he
thither horses, and chariots, and a
great host: and they came by night,
and compassed the city about. And
when the servant of the man of God
was risen early, and gone forth, behold,
an host compassed the city both
with horses and chariots. And his
servant said unto him, Alas, my master!
how shall we do? And he answered,
Fear not: for they that be
with us are more than they that be
with them. And Elisha prayed, and
said, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I pray thee, open his eyes,
that he may see. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
opened the eyes of the young man;
and he saw: and, behold, the mountain
was full of horses and chariots
of fire round about Elisha. And
when they came down to him, Elisha
prayed unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said, Smite
this people, I pray thee, with blindness.
And he smote them with blindness
according to the word of Elisha.</p>

<p>And Elisha said unto them, This is
not the way, neither is this the city:
follow me, and I will bring you to the
man whom ye seek. But he led them
to Samaria. And it came to pass,
when they were come into Samaria,
that Elisha said, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, open the eyes
of these men, that they may see. And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> opened their eyes, and they
saw; and, behold, they were in the
midst of Samaria. And the king of
Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
them, My father, shall I smite them?
shall I smite them? And he answered,
Thou shalt not smite them:
wouldest thou smite those whom thou
hast taken captive with thy sword
and with thy bow? set bread and
water before them, that they may eat
and drink, and go to their master.
And he prepared great provision for
them: and when they had eaten and
drunk, he sent them away, and they
went to their master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 7</div>

<p>And it came to pass after this, that
Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all
his host, and went up, and besieged
Samaria. And there was a great
famine in Samaria: and, behold, they
besieged it, until an ass's head was
sold for fourscore pieces of silver.</p>

<p>Then said the king, God do so and
more also to me, if the head of Elisha
the son of Shaphat shall stand on him
this day. But Elisha sat in his house,
and the elders sat with him; and the
king sent a man from before him: but
ere the messenger came to him, he
said to the elders, See ye how this
son of a murderer hath sent to take
away mine head? look, when the messenger
cometh, shut the door, and
hold him fast at the door: is not the
sound of his master's feet behind
him? And while he yet talked with
them, behold, the messenger came
down unto him: and he said, Behold,
this evil is of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; what should
I wait for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> any longer?</p>

<p>Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
To morrow about this time shall a
measure of fine flour be sold for a
shekel, and two measures of barley
for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
Then a lord on whose hand the king
leaned answered the man of God, and
said, Behold, if the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> would make
windows in heaven, might this thing
be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt
see it with thine eyes, but shalt not
eat thereof.</p>

<p>And there were four leprous men at
the entering in of the gate: and they
said one to another, Why sit we here
until we die? If we say, We will enter
into the city, then the famine is in
the city, and we shall die there: and
if we sit still here, we die also. Now
therefore come, and let us fall unto
the host of the Syrians: if they save
us alive, we shall live; and if they kill
us, we shall but die. And they rose
up in the twilight, to go unto the camp
of the Syrians: and when they were
come to the uttermost part of the
camp of Syria, behold, there was
no man there. For the Lord had
made the host of the Syrians to hear
a noise of chariots, and a noise of
horses, even the noise of a great host:
and they said one to another, Lo, the
king of Israel hath hired against us
the kings of the Hittites, and the
kings of the Egyptians, to come upon
us. Wherefore they arose and fled
in the twilight, and left their tents,
and their horses, and their asses, even
the camp as it was, and fled for their
life. And when these lepers came to
the uttermost part of the camp, they
went into one tent, and did eat and
drink, and carried thence silver, and
gold, and raiment, and went and hid
it; and came again, and entered into
another tent, and carried thence also,
and went and hid it. Then they said
one to another, We do not well: this
day is a day of good tidings, and we
hold our peace: if we tarry till the
morning light, some mischief will
come upon us: now therefore come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
that we may go and tell the king's
household. So they came and called
unto the porter of the city: and they
told them, saying, We came to the
camp of the Syrians, and, behold,
there was no man there, neither voice
of man, but horses tied, and asses
tied, and the tents as they were. And
he called the porters; and they told
it to the king's house within.</p>

<p>And the king arose in the night,
and said unto his servants, I will now
shew you what the Syrians have done
to us. They know that we be hungry;
therefore are they gone out of the
camp to hide themselves in the field,
saying, When they come out of the
city, we shall catch them alive, and
get into the city. And one of his servants
answered and said, Let some
take, I pray thee, five of the horses
that remain, which are left in the
city, (behold, they are as all the multitude
of Israel that are left in it: behold,
I say, they are even as all the
multitude of the Israelites that are
consumed:) and let us send and see.
They took therefore two chariot
horses; and the king sent after the
host of the Syrians, saying, Go and
see. And they went after them unto
Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full
of garments and vessels, which the
Syrians had cast away in their haste.
And the messengers returned, and
told the king. And the people went
out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians.
So a measure of fine flour was
sold for a shekel, and two measures
of barley for a shekel, according to
the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the king
appointed the lord on whose hand he
leaned to have the charge of the gate:
and the people trode upon him in the
gate, and he died, as the man of God
had said, who spake when the king
came down to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 8</div>

<p>And Elisha came to Damascus;
and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was
sick; and it was told him, saying, The
man of God is come hither. And the
king said unto Hazael, Take a present
in thine hand, and go, meet the man
of God, and enquire of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> by
him, saying, Shall I recover of this
disease? So Hazael went to meet
him, and took a present with him,
even of every good thing of Damascus,
forty camels' burden, and came
and stood before him, and said, Thy
son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath
sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover
of this disease? And Elisha
said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou
mayest certainly recover: howbeit
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath shewed me that he shall
surely die. And he settled his countenance
stedfastly, until he was
ashamed: and the man of God wept.
And Hazael said, Why weepeth my
lord? And he answered, Because I
know the evil that thou wilt do unto
the children of Israel: their strong
holds wilt thou set on fire, and their
young men wilt thou slay with the
sword, and wilt dash their children.
And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant
a dog, that he should do this
great thing? And Elisha answered,
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath shewed me that thou
shalt be king over Syria. So he departed
from Elisha, and came to his
master; who said to him, What said
Elisha to thee? And he answered,
He told me that thou shouldest surely
recover. And it came to pass on the
morrow, that he took a thick cloth,
and dipped it in water, and spread
it on his face, so that he died: and
Hazael reigned in his stead.</p>

<small>JEHU EXECUTES JUDGMENT ON
THE HOUSE OF AHAB</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 8</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>IN the fifth year of Joram the son
of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoram
the son of Jehoshaphat king of
Judah began to reign. Now when
Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom
of his father, he strengthened
himself, and slew all his brethren
with the sword, and divers also of the
princes of Israel. And he walked in
the way of the kings of Israel, like as
did the house of Ahab: for he had the
daughter of Ahab to wife: and he
wrought that which was evil in the
eyes of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Howbeit the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
would not destroy the house of David,
because of the covenant that he had
made with David, and as he promised
to give a light to him and to his sons
for ever. And there came a writing
to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,
Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of David
thy father, Because thou hast not
walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat
thy father, nor in the ways of Asa
king of Judah, but hast walked in the
way of the kings of Israel, and also
hast slain thy brethren of thy father's
house, which were better than thyself:
behold, with a great plague
will the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> smite thy people, and
thy children, and thy wives, and all
thy goods. And after all this the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> smote him with an incurable
disease: so he died of sore diseases.
And his people made no burning
for him, like the burning of his fathers.
Thirty and two years old
was he when he began to reign,
and he reigned in Jerusalem eight
years, and departed without being
desired. Howbeit they buried him
in the city of David, but not in the
sepulchres of the kings. And Ahaziah
his son reigned in his stead.
Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah
when he began to reign; and he
reigned one year in Jerusalem. And
he walked in the way of the house of
Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, as did the house of Ahab: for
he was the son in law of the house of
Ahab. And he went with Joram the
son of Ahab to the war against Hazael
king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and
the Syrians wounded Joram. And
king Joram went back to be healed
in Jezreel of the wounds which the
Syrians had given him at Ramah,
when he fought against Hazael king
of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of
Jehoram king of Judah went down
to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel,
because he was sick.</div>

<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 9</div>

<p>And Elisha the prophet called one
of the children of the prophets, and
said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and
take this box of oil in thine hand, and
go to Ramoth-gilead: and when thou
comest thither, look out there Jehu
the son of Jehoshaphat the son of
Nimshi, and go in, and make him
arise up from among his brethren,
and carry him to an inner chamber;
then take the box of oil, and pour it
on his head, and say, Thus saith the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I have anointed thee king over
Israel. Then open the door, and flee,
and tarry not.</p>

<p>So the young man went to Ramoth-gilead.
And when he came, behold,
the captains of the host were sitting;
and he said, I have an errand to thee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
O captain. And Jehu said, Unto
which of all us? And he said, To
thee, O captain. And he arose, and
went into the house; and he poured
the oil on his head, and said unto
him, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel,
I have anointed thee king over
the people of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, even over Israel.
And thou shalt smite the house
of Ahab thy master, that I may
avenge the blood of my servants the
prophets, and the blood of all the servants
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, at the hand of Jezebel.
And the dogs shall eat Jezebel
in the portion of Jezreel, and there
shall be none to bury her. And he
opened the door, and fled.</p>

<p>Then Jehu came forth to the servants
of his lord: and one said unto
him, Is all well? wherefore came this
mad fellow to thee? And he said
unto them, Ye know the man, and his
communication. And they said, It is
false; tell us now. And he said, Thus
and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus
saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I have anointed thee
king over Israel. Then they hasted,
and took every man his garment, and
put it under him on the top of the
stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying,
Jehu is king. And Jehu said, If
it be your minds, then let none go
forth nor escape out of the city to go
to tell it in Jezreel. So Jehu rode in
a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for
Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king
of Judah was come down to see
Joram. And there stood a watchman
on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied
the company of Jehu as he came, and
said, I see a company. And Joram
said, Take an horseman, and send to
meet them, and let him say, Is it
peace? So there went one on horseback
to meet him, and said, Thus
saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu
said, What hast thou to do with
peace? turn thee behind me. And
the watchman told, saying, The messenger
came to them, but he cometh
not again. Then he sent out a second
on horseback, which came to them,
and said, Thus saith the king, Is it
peace? And Jehu answered, What
hast thou to do with peace? turn thee
behind me. And the watchman told,
saying, He came even unto them, and
cometh not again: and the driving is
like the driving of Jehu the son of
Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.
And Joram said, Make ready. And
his chariot was made ready. And
Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah
king of Judah went out, each in his
chariot, and they went out against
Jehu, and met him in the portion of
Naboth the Jezreelite. And it came
to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that
he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he
answered, What peace, so long as the
sins of thy mother Jezebel and her
witchcrafts are so many? And Joram
turned his hands, and fled, and
said to Ahaziah, There is treachery,
O Ahaziah. And Jehu drew a bow
with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
between his arms, and the
arrow went out at his heart, and he
sunk down in his chariot. Then said
Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up,
and cast him in the portion of the field
of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember
how that, when I and thou rode
together after Ahab his father, the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> laid this burden upon him;
surely I have seen yesterday the
blood of Naboth, and the blood of his
sons, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and I will requite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
thee in this plat, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
Now therefore take and cast him
into the plat of ground, according to
the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>But when Ahaziah the king of Judah
saw this, he fled by the way of
the garden house. And Jehu followed
after him, and said, Smite him
also in the chariot. And they did so
at the going up to Gur, which is by
Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and
died there. And his servants carried
him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
buried him in his sepulchre with his
fathers in the city of David.</p>

<p>And when Jehu was come to Jezreel,
Jezebel heard of it; and she
painted her face, and tired her head,
and looked out at a window. And as
Jehu entered in at the gate, she said,
Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?
And he lifted up his face to the
window, and said, Who is on my side?
who? And there looked out to him
two or three officers. And he said,
Throw her down. So they threw her
down: and some of her blood was
sprinkled on the wall, and on the
horses: and he trode her under foot.
And when he was come in, he did eat
and drink, and said, Go, see now this
cursed woman, and bury her: for she
is a king's daughter. And they went
to bury her: but they found no more
of her than the skull, and the feet,
and the palms of her hands. Wherefore
they came again, and told him.
And he said, This is the word of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, which he spake by his servant
Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the
portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the
flesh of Jezebel: and the carcase of
Jezebel shall be as dung upon the
face of the field in the portion of Jezreel;
so that they shall not say, This
is Jezebel.</p>

<p>So Jehu slew all that remained of
the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all
his great men, and his kinsfolks, and
his priests, until he left him none remaining.
And they brought forth
the images out of the house of Baal,
and burned them. And they brake
down the image of Baal, and brake
down the house of Baal, and made it
a draught house unto this day. Thus
Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
But Jehu took no heed to walk in the
law of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel with
all his heart: for he departed not
from the sins of Jeroboam, which
made Israel to sin. In those days the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> began to cut Israel short: and
Hazael smote them in all the coasts of
Israel.</p>

<p>And Jehu slept with his fathers:
and they buried him in Samaria.
And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his
stead. And the time that Jehu
reigned over Israel in Samaria was
twenty and eight years.</p>

<small>JOASH, KING OF JUDAH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 11</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>WHEN Athaliah the mother
of Ahaziah saw that her
son was dead, she arose
and destroyed all the seed royal.
But Jehosheba, the daughter of king
Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash
the son of Ahaziah, and stole him
from among the king's sons which
were slain; and they hid him, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
him and his nurse, in the bedchamber
from Athaliah, so that he was not
slain. And he was with her hid in
the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> six years. And
Athaliah did reign over the land.</div>

<p>And the seventh year Jehoiada
sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds,
with the captains and the
guard, and brought them to him into
the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and made a
covenant with them, and took an oath
of them in the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
shewed them the king's son. And the
captains over the hundreds did according
to all things that Jehoiada
the priest commanded. And to the
captains over hundreds did the priest
give king David's spears and shields,
that were in the temple of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
And the guard stood, every man with
his weapons in his hand, round about
the king, from the right corner of the
temple to the left corner of the temple,
along by the altar and the temple.
And he brought forth the king's son,
and put the crown upon him, and gave
him the testimony; and they made
him king, and anointed him; and they
clapped their hands, and said, God
save the king.</p>

<p>And when Athaliah heard the
noise of the guard and of the people,
she came to the people into the temple
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And when she
looked, behold, the king stood by a
pillar, as the manner was, and the
princes and the trumpeters by the
king, and all the people of the land
rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and
Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried,
Treason, Treason. But Jehoiada
the priest commanded the captains of
the hundreds, the officers of the host,
and said unto them, Have her forth
without the ranges: and him that followeth
her kill with the sword. For
the priest had said, Let her not be
slain in the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
they laid hands on her; and she went
by the way by which the horses
came into the king's house: and there
was she slain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 12</div>

<p>And Jehoiada made a covenant between
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and the king and the
people, that they should be the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>
people; between the king also and the
people. And all the people of the
land went into the house of Baal, and
brake it down; his altars and his images
brake they in pieces thoroughly,
and slew Mattan the priest of Baal
before the altars. And the priest appointed
officers over the house of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And he took the rulers over
hundreds, and the captains, and the
guard, and all the people of the land;
and they brought down the king from
the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and came by
the way of the gate of the guard to
the king's house. And he sat on the
throne of the kings. And all the people
of the land rejoiced, and the city
was in quiet. Seven years old was
Joash when he began to reign. In
the seventh year of Jehu Joash began
to reign; and forty years reigned he
in Jerusalem, and did that which was
right in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> all his
days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed
him. But Jehoiada waxed
old, and was full of days when he
died; an hundred and thirty years old
was he when he died. And they
buried him in the city of David
among the kings, because he had done
good in Israel, both toward God, and
toward his house. Now after the
death of Jehoiada came the princes
of Judah, and made obeisance to the
king. Then the king hearkened unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
them. And they left the house of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of their fathers, and served
groves and idols: and wrath came
upon Judah and Jerusalem for this
their trespass. And the Spirit of God
came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
the priest, which stood above
the people, and said unto them, Thus
saith God, Why transgress ye the
commandments of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that ye
cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, he hath also forsaken
you. And they conspired against
him, and stoned him with stones at
the commandment of the king in the
court of the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Thus
Joash the king remembered not the
kindness which Jehoiada his father
had done to him, but slew his son.
And when he died, he said, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
look upon it, and require it.</p>

<p>And it came to pass at the end of
the year, that the host of Syria came
up against him: and they came to
Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed
all the princes of the people from
among the people, and sent all the
spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.
For the army of the Syrians
came with a small company of men,
and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> delivered a very great
host into their hand, because they had
forsaken the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of their fathers.
So they executed judgment
against Joash. And when they were
departed from him, (for they left him
in great diseases,) his own servants
conspired against him for the blood
of the sons of Jehoiada the priest,
and slew him on his bed, and he died:
and they buried him in the city of
David, but they buried him not in
the sepulchres of the kings. And
Amaziah his son reigned in his
stead.</p>

<small>DEATH OF ELISHA</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 13</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>IN the three and twentieth year
of Joash the son of Ahaziah
king of Judah Jehoahaz the son
of Jehu began to reign over Israel
in Samaria, and reigned seventeen
years. And he did that which was
evil in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
the anger of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was kindled
against Israel, and he delivered them
into the hand of Hazael king of
Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad
the son of Hazael, all their
days. And Jehoahaz besought the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hearkened unto
him: for he saw the oppression of Israel,
because the king of Syria oppressed
them. (And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> gave
Israel a saviour, so that they went
out from under the hand of the Syrians:
and the children of Israel
dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.
Nevertheless they departed not from
the sins of the house of Jeroboam,
who made Israel sin, but walked
therein: and there remained the
grove also in Samaria.) Neither did
he leave of the people to Jehoahaz
but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots,
and ten thousand footmen; for the
king of Syria had destroyed them,
and had made them like the dust by
threshing. And Jehoahaz slept with
his fathers; and they buried him in
Samaria: and Joash his son reigned
in his stead.</div>

<p>Now Elisha was fallen sick of his
sickness whereof he died. And Joash
the king of Israel came down unto
him, and wept over his face, and said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
O my father, my father, the chariot
of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
And Elisha said unto him, Take bow
and arrows. And he took unto him
bow and arrows. And he said to the
king of Israel, Put thine hand upon
the bow. And he put his hand upon
it: and Elisha put his hands upon the
king's hands. And he said, Open the
window eastward. And he opened it.
Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he
shot. And he said, The arrow of the
<span class="smcap">Lord's</span> deliverance, and the arrow of
deliverance from Syria: for thou
shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek,
till thou have consumed them. And
he said, Take the arrows. And he
took them. And he said unto the king
of Israel, Smite upon the ground.
And he smote thrice, and stayed.
And the man of God was wroth with
him, and said, Thou shouldest have
smitten five or six times; then hadst
thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed
it: whereas now thou shalt
smite Syria but thrice.</p>

<p>And Elisha died, and they buried
him. And the bands of the Moabites
invaded the land at the coming in of
the year. And it came to pass, as
they were burying a man, that, behold,
they spied a band of men; and
they cast the man into the sepulchre
of Elisha: and when the man was let
down, and touched the bones of Elisha,
he revived, and stood up on his
feet.</p>

<small>JOASH AND AMAZIAH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 14-15</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>IN the second year of Joash king
of Israel reigned Amaziah king
of Judah. And he did that
which was right in the sight of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And it came to pass, as soon
as the kingdom was confirmed in his
hand, that he slew his servants which
had slain the king his father. But
the children of the murderers he slew
not: according unto that which is
written in the book of the law of
Moses, wherein the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded,
saying, The fathers shall not be put
to death for the children, nor the children
be put to death for the fathers;
but every man shall be put to death
for his own sin. Then Amaziah
king of Judah took advice, and sent
to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son
of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come,
let us see one another in the face.
And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah
king of Judah, saying, The
thistle that was in Lebanon sent to
the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying,
Give thy daughter to my son to
wife: and there passed by a wild
beast that was in Lebanon, and trode
down the thistle. So Joash the king
of Israel went up; and Judah was
put to the worse before Israel, and
they fled every man to his tent. And
Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah
king of Judah, the son of Joash,
the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh,
and brought him to Jerusalem, and
brake down the wall of Jerusalem
from the gate of Ephraim to the
corner gate, four hundred cubits.
And Joash slept with his fathers, and
was buried in Samaria with the kings
of Israel; and Jeroboam his son
reigned in his stead. And Amaziah
the son of Joash king of Judah lived
after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz
king of Israel fifteen years.
Now they made a conspiracy against
him in Jerusalem: and he fled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Lachish; but they sent after him to
Lachish, and slew him there. And
they brought him on horses: and he
was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers
in the city of David. And all
the people of Judah took Azariah,
which was sixteen years old, and
made him king instead of his father
Amaziah. And Azariah, who was
also called Uzziah, reigned over Judah
fifty and two years, and he did
that which was right in the sight
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. But the kings of Israel
were evil kings: Jeroboam and
Zachariah his son, and Shallum and
Menahem and Pekahiah. In the two
and fiftieth year of Azariah king of
Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah
conspired against Pekahiah, and
killed him, and reigned in his stead.
And he did that which was evil in
the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. In the days of
Pekah came Tiglath-pileser king of
Assyria, and took all the land of
Naphtali, and carried them captive to
Assyria. And Hoshea the son of
Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah
the son of Remaliah, and smote
him, and slew him, and reigned in his
stead.</div>

<p>In the second year of Pekah the
son of Remaliah king of Israel began
Jotham the son of Uzziah king of
Judah to reign. Five and twenty
years old was he when he began to
reign, and he reigned sixteen years in
Jerusalem. He fought also with the
king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
against them. And the children of
Ammon gave him the same year an
hundred talents of silver, and ten
thousand measures of wheat, and ten
thousand of barley. So much did the
children of Ammon pay unto him,
both the second year, and the third.
So Jotham became mighty, because
he prepared his ways before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
his God. And Jotham slept with his
fathers, and they buried him in the
city of David: and Ahaz his son
reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>Ahaz was twenty years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen
years in Jerusalem: but he did
not that which was right in the sight
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, like David his father: for
he walked in the ways of the kings of
Israel, and made also molten images
for Baalim. Wherefore the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his
God delivered him into the hand of
the king of Syria; and they smote
him, and carried away a great multitude
of them captives, and brought
them to Damascus. And he was also
delivered into the hand of the king
of Israel, who smote him with a great
slaughter. And the children of Israel
carried away captive of their brethren
two hundred thousand, women,
sons, and daughters, and took also
away much spoil from them, and
brought the spoil to Samaria. For
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> brought Judah low because
of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made
Judah naked, and transgressed sore
against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Tiglath-pileser
king of Assyria came unto him,
and distressed him, but strengthened
him not. For Ahaz took away a portion
out of the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
out of the house of the king, and of
the princes, and gave it unto the king
of Assyria: but he helped him not.
And in the time of his distress did he
trespass yet more against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>:
this is that king Ahaz. For he sacrificed
unto the gods of Damascus,
which smote him: and he said, Because
the gods of the kings of Syria
help them, therefore will I sacrifice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
them, that they may help me. But
they were the ruin of him, and of all
Israel. And Ahaz slept with his fathers,
and they buried him in the city,
even in Jerusalem: but they brought
him not into the sepulchres of the
kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his
son reigned in his stead.</p>

<small>ISRAEL CARRIED AWAY CAPTIVE
INTO ASSYRIA</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 17</div>
<div class='drop-cap'>IN the twelfth year of Ahaz king
of Judah began Hoshea the son
of Elah to reign in Samaria over
Israel nine years. And he did that
which was evil in the sight of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</div>

<p>Against him came up Shalmaneser
king of Assyria; and Hoshea became
his servant, and gave him presents.
And the king of Assyria found conspiracy
in Hoshea: for he had sent
messengers to So king of Egypt, and
brought no present to the king of Assyria,
as he had done year by year:
therefore the king of Assyria shut
him up, and bound him in prison.
Then the king of Assyria came up
throughout all the land, and went up
to Samaria, and besieged it three
years.</p>

<p>In the ninth year of Hoshea the
king of Assyria took Samaria, and
carried Israel away into Assyria, and
placed them in Halah and in Habor
by the river of Gozan, and in the
cities of the Medes. For so it was,
that the children of Israel had sinned
against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> their God, which had
brought them up out of the land of
Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh
king of Egypt, and had feared
other gods. Yet the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> testified
against Israel, and against Judah, by
all the prophets, and by all the seers,
saying, Turn ye from your evil ways,
and keep my commandments and my
statutes, according to all the law
which I commanded your fathers,
and which I sent to you by my servants
the prophets. Notwithstanding
they would not hear, but hardened
their necks, like to the neck of their
fathers, that did not believe in the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> their God. And they left all
the commandments of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> their
God, and made them molten images,
even two calves, and made a grove,
and worshipped all the host of heaven,
and served Baal. And they caused
their sons and their daughters to pass
through the fire, and used divination
and enchantments, and sold themselves
to do evil in the sight of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to provoke him to anger.
Therefore the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was very angry
with Israel, and removed them out of
his sight: there was none left but the
tribe of Judah only. Also Judah
kept not the commandments of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> their God, but walked in the
statutes of Israel which they made.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> rejected all the seed of
Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered
them into the hand of spoilers,
until he had cast them out of his
sight, as he had said by all his servants
the prophets. So was Israel
carried away out of their own land
to Assyria unto this day. And the
king of Assyria brought people from
his own country, and placed them in
the cities of Samaria instead of the
children of Israel: and they possessed
Samaria, and dwelt in the cities
thereof.</p>

<small>SENNACHERIB INVADES THE
LAND</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 18</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW it came to pass in the
third year of Hoshea son of
Elah king of Israel, that
Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of
Judah began to reign. And he did
that which was right in the sight of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, according to all that David
his father did. He removed the high
places, and brake the images, and cut
down the groves, and brake in pieces
the brasen serpent that Moses had
made: for unto those days the children
of Israel did burn incense to it:
and he called it Nehushtan. He
trusted in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel; so
that after him was none like him
among all the kings of Judah, nor any
that were before him. For he clave
to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and departed not from
following him, but kept his commandments,
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> commanded
Moses. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was with him;
and he prospered whithersoever he
went forth: and he rebelled against
the king of Assyria, and served him
not. And when Hezekiah saw that
Sennacherib was come, and that he
was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
he took counsel with his
princes and his mighty men to stop
the waters of the fountains which
were without the city: and they did
help him. So there was gathered
much people together, who stopped
all the fountains, and the brook that
ran through the midst of the land,
saying, Why should the kings of Assyria
come, and find much water?
Also he strengthened himself, and
built up all the wall that was broken,
and raised it up to the towers, and
another wall without, and repaired
Millo in the city of David, and made
darts and shields in abundance. And
he set captains of war over the people,
and gathered them together to
him in the street of the gate of the
city, and spake comfortably to them,
saying, Be strong and courageous, be
not afraid nor dismayed for the king
of Assyria, nor for all the multitude
that is with him: for there be more
with us than with him: with him is an
arm of flesh; but with us is the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
our God to help us, and to fight our
battles. And the people rested themselves
upon the words of Hezekiah
king of Judah.</div>

<p>After this did Sennacherib king of
Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem,
unto Hezekiah king of Judah,
and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem,
saying, Thus saith Sennacherib
king of Assyria, Whereon do
ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in
Jerusalem? Doth not Hezekiah persuade
you to give over yourselves to
die by famine and by thirst, saying,
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God shall deliver us out
of the hand of the king of Assyria?
Know ye not what I and my fathers
have done unto all the people of
other lands? were the gods of the nations
of those lands any ways able to
deliver their lands out of mine hand?
Who was there among all the gods of
those nations that could deliver his
people out of mine hand, that your
God should be able to deliver you out
of mine hand? Now therefore let not
Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade
you on this manner, neither yet believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
him: for no god of any nation
or kingdom was able to deliver his
people out of mine hand, and out of
the hand of my fathers: how much
less shall your God deliver you out of
mine hand? And his servants spake
yet more against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God, and
against his servant Hezekiah. He
wrote also letters to rail on the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
God of Israel, and to speak against
him.</p>

<p>Then they cried with a loud voice
in the Jews' speech unto the people
of Jerusalem that were on the wall,
to affright them, and to trouble them;
that they might take the city. And
they spake against the God of Jerusalem,
as against the gods of the people
of the earth, which were the work
of the hands of man. And for this
cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet
Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed
and cried to heaven.</p>

<p>And Hezekiah received the letter
of the hand of the messengers, and
read it: and Hezekiah went up into
the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and spread it
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And Hezekiah
prayed before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said, O
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel, which dwellest
between the cherubims, thou art the
God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms
of the earth; thou hast made
heaven and earth. <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, bow down
thine ear, and hear: open, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, thine
eyes, and see: and hear the words of
Sennacherib, which hath sent him to
reproach the living God. Of a truth,
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the kings of Assyria have destroyed
the nations and their lands,
and have cast their gods into the fire:
for they were no gods, but the work
of men's hands, wood and stone:
therefore they have destroyed them.
Now therefore, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God, I
beseech thee, save thou us out of his
hand, that all the kingdoms of the
earth may know that thou art the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God, even thou only.</p>

<p>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent
to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel, That which thou
hast prayed to me against Sennacherib
king of Assyria I have heard.
Therefore thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> concerning
the king of Assyria, He shall
not come into this city, nor shoot an
arrow there, nor come before it with
shield, nor cast a bank against it. By
the way that he came, by the same
shall he return, and shall not come
into this city, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. For I
will defend this city, to save it, for
mine own sake, and for my servant
David's sake.</p>

<p>And it came to pass that night, that
the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> went out, and
smote in the camp of the Assyrians
an hundred fourscore and five thousand:
and when they arose early in
the morning, behold, they were all
dead corpses. So Sennacherib king of
Assyria departed, and went and returned,
and dwelt at Nineveh. And
it came to pass, as he was worshipping
in the house of Nisroch his god,
that two of his sons smote him with
the sword. And Esarhaddon his son
reigned in his stead.</p>

<small>HEZEKIAH'S SICKNESS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Kings 20</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>IN those days was Hezekiah sick
unto death. And the prophet
Isaiah the son of Amoz came to
him, and said unto him, Thus saith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Set thine house in order;
for thou shalt die, and not live. Then
he turned his face to the wall, and
prayed unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, saying, I beseech
thee, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, remember now
how I have walked before thee in
truth and with a perfect heart, and
have done that which is good in thy
sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</div>

<p>And it came to pass, afore Isaiah
was gone out into the middle court,
that the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came to
him, saying, Turn again, and tell Hezekiah
the captain of my people, Thus
saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the God of David thy
father, I have heard thy prayer, I
have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal
thee: on the third day thou shalt go
up unto the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
I will add unto thy days fifteen years;
and I will deliver thee and this city
out of the hand of the king of Assyria;
and I will defend this city for
mine own sake, and for my servant
David's sake. And Isaiah said, Take
a lump of figs. And they took and
laid it on the boil, and he recovered.</p>

<p>And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah,
What shall be the sign that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
will heal me, and that I shall go up
into the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> the third
day? And Isaiah said, This sign
shalt thou have of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> will do the thing that he hath
spoken: shall the shadow go forward
ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?
And Hezekiah answered, It is a light
thing for the shadow to go down ten
degrees: nay, but let the shadow return
backward ten degrees. And
Isaiah the prophet cried unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and he brought the shadow ten
degrees backward, by which it had
gone down in the dial of Ahaz.</p>

<p>At that time Berodach-baladan,
king of Babylon, sent letters and a
present unto Hezekiah: for he had
heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
And Hezekiah hearkened unto them,
and shewed them all the house of his
precious things, the silver, and the
gold, and the spices, and the precious
ointment, and all the house of his armour,
and all that was found in his
treasures: there was nothing in his
house, nor in all his dominion, that
Hezekiah shewed them not. Then
came Isaiah the prophet unto king
Hezekiah, and said unto him, What
said these men? and from whence
came they unto thee? And Hezekiah
said, They are come from a far country,
even from Babylon. And he
said, What have they seen in thine
house? And Hezekiah answered, All
the things that are in mine house have
they seen: there is nothing among my
treasures that I have not shewed
them. And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah,
Hear the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
Behold, the days come, that all that is
in thine house, and that which thy fathers
have laid up in store unto this
day, shall be carried into Babylon:
nothing shall be left, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers:
and Manasseh his son reigned
in his stead.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_125" id="CHAPTER_125">CHAPTER 125</a><br />

<small>MANASSEH, AMON, AND JOSIAH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Chronicles 33-34</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>MANASSEH was twelve years
old when he began to reign,
and he reigned fifty and five
years in Jerusalem: but did that
which was evil in the sight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, like unto the abominations of
the heathen, whom the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had cast
out before the children of Israel. For
he built again the high places which
Hezekiah his father had broken down,
and he reared up altars for Baalim,
and made groves, and worshipped all
the host of heaven, and served them.
And he set a carved image, the idol
which he had made, in the house of
God, of which God had said to David
and to Solomon his son, In this house,
and in Jerusalem, which I have
chosen before all the tribes of Israel,
will I put my name for ever. So
Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants
of Jerusalem to err, and to do
worse than the heathen, whom the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> had destroyed before the children
of Israel. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake
to Manasseh, and to his people: but
they would not hearken. Wherefore
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> brought upon them the captains
of the host of the king of Assyria,
which took Manasseh among
the thorns, and bound him with fetters,
and carried him to Babylon.
And when he was in affliction, he besought
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God, and humbled
himself greatly before the God
of his fathers, and prayed unto him:
and he was intreated of him, and
heard his supplication, and brought
him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom.
Then Manasseh knew that the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> he was God. So Manasseh
slept with his fathers, and they buried
him in his own house: and Amon his
son reigned in his stead. But he did
that which was evil in the sight of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, as did Manasseh his father; and
humbled not himself before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
as Manasseh his father had humbled
himself; but Amon trespassed more
and more. And his servants conspired
against him, and slew him in
his own house. But the people of the
land slew all them that had conspired
against king Amon; and the people of
the land made Josiah his son king in
his stead. Josiah was eight years old
when he began to reign, and he
reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty
years. And he did that which was
right in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. For
in the eighth year of his reign, while
he was yet young, he began to seek
after the God of David his father:
and in the twelfth year he began to
purge Judah and Jerusalem from the
high places, and the groves, and the
carved images, and the molten images.
And they brake down the altars
of Baalim in his presence; and
the images, that were on high above
them, he cut down; and the groves,
and the carved images, and the molten
images, he brake in pieces, and
made dust of them, and strowed it
upon the graves of them that had sacrificed
unto them. And he burnt the
bones of the priests upon their altars,
and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
And so did he in the cities of Manasseh,
and Ephraim, and Simeon, even
unto Naphtali. And when he had cut
down all the idols throughout all the
land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</div>

<p>Now in the eighteenth year of his
reign, when he had purged the land,
and the house, he sent Shaphan and
Maaseiah the governor of the city,
and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder,
to repair the house of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God. And when they
brought out the money that was
brought into the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
Hilkiah the priest found a book of the
law of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> given by Moses. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
Then Shaphan the scribe told
the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest
hath given me a book. And Shaphan
read it before the king. And it came
to pass, when the king had heard the
words of the law, that he rent his
clothes. And the king commanded,
saying, Go, enquire of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> for
me, and for them that are left in Israel
and in Judah, concerning the
words of the book that is found: for
great is the wrath of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that is
poured out upon us, because our fathers
have not kept the word of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to do after all that is written
in this book. And Hilkiah, and they
that the king had appointed, went to
Huldah the prophetess; and they
spake to her to that effect. And she
answered them, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
God of Israel, Tell ye the man that
sent you to me, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
Behold, I will bring evil upon this
place, and upon the inhabitants thereof,
even all the curses that are written
in the book which they have read before
the king of Judah: because they
have forsaken me, and have burned
incense unto other gods, that they
might provoke me to anger with all
the works of their hands; therefore
my wrath shall be poured out upon
this place, and shall not be quenched.
And as for the king of Judah, who
sent you to enquire of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, so
shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel concerning the
words which thou hast heard; Because
thine heart was tender, and
thou didst humble thyself before God,
when thou heardest his words against
this place, and against the inhabitants
thereof, and humbledst thyself before
me, and didst rend thy clothes, and
weep before me; I have even heard
thee also, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Behold, I
will gather thee to thy fathers, and
thou shalt be gathered to thy grave
in peace, neither shall thine eyes see
all the evil that I will bring upon this
place, and upon the inhabitants of the
same. So they brought the king word
again.</p>

<p>Then the king sent and gathered
together all the elders of Judah and
Jerusalem, and all the men of Judah,
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and the priests, and the Levites, and
all the people, great and small: and
he read in their ears all the words of
the book of the covenant that was
found in the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
the king stood in his place, and made
a covenant before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to walk
after the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and to keep his commandments,
and his testimonies, and
his statutes, with all his heart, and
with all his soul, to perform the words
of the covenant which are written in
this book. And he caused all that
were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin
to stand to it. And the inhabitants
of Jerusalem did according to
the covenant of God, the God of their
fathers. And Josiah took away all
the abominations out of all the countries
that pertained to the children
of Israel, and made all that were
present in Israel to serve, even
to serve the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> their God. And
all his days they departed not from
following the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the God of their
fathers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">II. Chronicles 35</div>

<p>Moreover Josiah kept a passover
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in Jerusalem: and they
killed the passover on the fourteenth
day of the first month. And he set
the priests in their charges, and encouraged
them to the service of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the children
of Israel that were present kept the
passover at that time, and the feast
of unleavened bread seven days.
And there was no passover like to
that kept in Israel from the days of
Samuel the prophet; neither did all
the kings of Israel keep such a passover
as Josiah kept, and the priests,
and the Levites, and all Judah and
Israel that were present, and the inhabitants
of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>After all this, when Josiah had prepared
the temple, Necho king of
Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish
by Euphrates: and Josiah
went out against him. And the
archers shot at king Josiah; and the
king said to his servants, Have me
away; for I am sore wounded. His
servants therefore took him out of
that chariot, and put him in the second
chariot that he had; and they
brought him to Jerusalem, and he
died, and was buried in one of the
sepulchres of his fathers. And all
Judah and Jerusalem mourned for
Josiah. And Jeremiah lamented for
Josiah: and all the singing men and
the singing women spake of Josiah
in their lamentations to this day, and
made them an ordinance in Israel:
and, behold, they are written in the
lamentations.</p>

<small>THE BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="150" height="176" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THEN the people of
the land took Jehoahaz
the son of
Josiah, and made
him king in his
father's stead in
Jerusalem. Jehoahaz
was twenty
and three years
old when he began to reign, and he
reigned three months in Jerusalem.
And the king of Egypt put him down
at Jerusalem, and condemned the
land in an hundred talents of silver
and a talent of gold. And the king of
Egypt made Eliakim his brother king
over Judah and Jerusalem, and
turned his name to Jehoiakim; and
took Jehoahaz, and carried him to
Egypt.</div>

<p>Jehoiakim was twenty and five
years old when he began to reign, and
he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:
and he did that which was evil
in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God.
Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon, and bound him
in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
And Jehoiachin his son reigned in
his stead.</p>

<p>And Jehoiachin did that which was
evil in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And
when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar
sent, and brought him
to Babylon, with the goodly vessels
of the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and made
Zedekiah his brother king over Judah
and Jerusalem. Zedekiah was one
and twenty years old when he began
to reign, and reigned eleven years in
Jerusalem. And he did that which
was evil in the sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his
God, and humbled not himself before
Jeremiah the prophet speaking from
the mouth of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And he also
rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
who had made him swear by God:
but he stiffened his neck, and hardened
his heart from turning unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel.</p>

<p>And it came to pass in the ninth
year of his reign, in the tenth month,
in the tenth day of the month, that
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
came, he, and all his host, against
Jerusalem, and pitched against it;
and they built forts against it round
about. And the city was besieged
unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
And on the ninth day of
the fourth month the famine prevailed
in the city, and there was no
bread for the people of the land.
And the city was broken up, and all
the men of war fled by night by the
way of the gate between two walls,
which is by the king's garden: (now
the Chaldees were against the city
round about:) and the king went the
way toward the plain. And the army
of the Chaldees pursued after the
king, and overtook him in the plains
of Jericho: and all his army were
scattered from him. So they took the
king, and brought him up to the king
of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave
judgment upon him. And they slew
the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes,
and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and
bound him with fetters of brass, and
carried him to Babylon.</p>

<p>And all the vessels of the house of
God, great and small, and the treasures
of the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
the treasures of the king, and of his
princes; all these Nebuchadnezzar
brought to Babylon. And they burnt
the house of God, and brake down the
wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the
palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed
all the goodly vessels thereof.
And them that had escaped from the
sword carried he away to Babylon;
where they were servants to him and
his sons until the reign of the kingdom
of Persia: to fulfil the word of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> by the mouth of Jeremiah,
until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths:
for as long as she lay desolate
she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore
and ten years.</p>

<small>THE RETURN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Ezra 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW in the first year of Cyrus
king of Persia, that the word
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> by the mouth of
Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of
Persia, that he made a proclamation
throughout all his kingdom, and put
it also in writing, saying, Thus saith
Cyrus king of Persia, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God
of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms
of the earth; and he hath
charged me to build him an house at
Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who
is there among you of all his people?
his God be with him, and let him go
up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah,
and build the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God
of Israel, (he is the God,) which is
in Jerusalem. Then rose up the chief
of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin,
and the priests, and the Levites,
with all them whose spirit God had
raised, to go up to build the house
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> which is in Jerusalem.
And all they that were about them
strengthened their hands with vessels
of silver, with gold, with goods,
and with beasts, and with precious
things.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Also Cyrus the king brought forth
the vessels of the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
which Nebuchadnezzar had brought
forth out of Jerusalem, and had put
them in the house of his gods; even
those did Cyrus king of Persia bring
forth, and numbered them unto
Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</p>

<p>Now the children of the province
that went up out of the captivity, of
those which had been carried away,
whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of
Babylon had carried away unto Babylon,
and came again unto Jerusalem
and Judah, every one unto his
city; the whole congregation together
was forty and two thousand three
hundred and threescore, beside their
servants and their maids, of whom
there were seven thousand three hundred
thirty and seven: and there were
among them two hundred singing
men and singing women. Their
horses were seven hundred thirty and
six; their mules, two hundred forty
and five; their camels, four hundred
thirty and five; their asses, six thousand
seven hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>And some of the chief of the fathers,
when they came to the house of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> which is at Jerusalem, offered
freely for the house of God to
set it up in his place: they gave after
their ability unto the treasure of the
work threescore and one thousand
drams of gold, and five thousand
pound of silver, and one hundred
priests' garments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ezra 3</div>

<p>And when the seventh month was
come, and the children of Israel were
in the cities, the people gathered
themselves together as one man to
Jerusalem. Then stood up Jeshua
the son of Jozadak, and his brethren
the priests, and Zerubbabel the son
of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and
builded the altar of the God of Israel,
to offer burnt offerings thereon, as
it is written in the law of Moses the
man of God. And they offered burnt
offerings thereon unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
even burnt offerings morning and
evening.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<small>THE SECOND TEMPLE</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND when the builders laid the
foundation of the temple of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, they set the priests
in their apparel with trumpets, and
the Levites the sons of Asaph with
cymbals, to praise the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, after the
ordinance of David king of Israel.
And they sang together by course in
praising and giving thanks unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>; because he is good, for his
mercy endureth for ever toward Israel.
And all the people shouted
with a great shout, when they praised
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, because the foundation of
the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was laid. But
many of the priests and Levites and
chief of the fathers, who were ancient
men, that had seen the first house,
when the foundation of this house was
laid before their eyes, wept with a
loud voice; and many shouted aloud
for joy: so that the people could not
discern the noise of the shout of joy
from the noise of the weeping of the
people: for the people shouted with
a loud shout, and the noise was heard
afar off.</div>

<p>Then the people of the land weakened
the hands of the people of Judah,
and troubled them in building.
And Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the scribe wrote a letter against
Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king of
Persia in this sort: be it known unto
the king, that this city is a rebellious
city, and that they have moved sedition
within the same of old time: for
which cause was this city destroyed.
Then sent the king an answer, saying,
Give ye now commandment to cause
these men to cease, and that this city
be not builded, until another commandment
shall be given from me.
Then ceased the work of the house of
God which is at Jerusalem. So it
ceased unto the second year of the
reign of Darius king of Persia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ezra 5</div>

<p>Then the prophets Haggai and
Zechariah prophesied unto the Jews
that were in Judah and Jerusalem in
the name of the God of Israel. Then
rose up Zerubbabel and Jeshua, and
began to build the house of God which
is at Jerusalem: and with them were
the prophets of God helping them.
At the same time came to them Tatnai,
governor on this side the river,
and Shethar-boznai, and their companions,
and said thus unto them,
Who hath commanded you to build
this house, and to make up this wall?
But the eye of their God was upon
the elders of the Jews, that they could
not cause them to cease, till the matter
came to Darius.</p>

<p>Then Tatnai sent a letter unto Darius
the king concerning this matter,
wherein was written that the Jews
had answered him, saying, In the first
year of Cyrus the king of Babylon
the same king Cyrus made a decree
to build this house of God, and to
take the vessels also of gold and silver
of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar
took out of the temple
that was in Jerusalem, and carry
them into the temple that is in Jerusalem,
and let the house of God be
builded in his place.</p>

<p>Then Darius the king made a decree,
and search was made in the
house of the rolls, where the treasures
were laid up in Babylon. And there
was found a decree of Cyrus the king
to build the house of God at Jerusalem,
and also that the golden and silver
vessels of the house of God, which
Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the
temple which is at Jerusalem, and
brought unto Babylon, be restored,
and brought again unto the temple
which is at Jerusalem, every one to
his place.</p>

<p>Now therefore, wrote Darius, let
the work of this house of God alone;
let the governor of the Jews and the
elders of the Jews build this house of
God in his place. Moreover I make a
decree what ye shall do to the elders
of these Jews for the building of this
house of God: that of the king's
goods, even of the tribute beyond the
river, forthwith expences be given
unto these men, that they be not hindered.
And that which they have
need of, both young bullocks, and
rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings
of the God of heaven, wheat,
salt, wine, and oil, according to the
appointment of the priests which are
at Jerusalem, let it be given them day
by day without fail: that they may
offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto
the God of heaven, and pray for the
life of the king, and of his sons. Also
I have made a decree, that whosoever
shall alter this word, let timber be
pulled down from his house, and
being set up, let him be hanged
thereon. And the God that hath
caused his name to dwell there destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
all kings and people, that shall
put to their hand to alter and to destroy
this house of God which is at
Jerusalem. I Darius have made a
decree; let it be done with speed.</p>

<p>Then Tatnai, Shethar-boznai, and
their companions, according to that
which Darius the king had sent, so
they did speedily. And the elders of
the Jews builded, and this house was
finished in the sixth year of the reign
of Darius the king.</p>

<p>And the children of Israel, the
priests, and the Levites, and the rest
of the children of the captivity, kept
the dedication of this house of God
with joy: and they made an offering
at the dedication of this house of God,
and a sin offering for all Israel. And
they set the priests in their divisions,
and the Levites in their courses, for
the service of God, which is at Jerusalem;
as it is written in the book of
Moses. And the children of the captivity
kept the passover upon the
fourteenth day of the first month.
And the children of Israel kept the
feast of unleavened bread seven days
with joy: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had made them
joyful, and turned the heart of the
king of Assyria unto them, to
strengthen their hands in the work
of the house of God, the God of Israel.</p>

<small>EZRA GOES UP FROM BABYLON</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Ezra 7</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW after these things, in the
reign of Artaxerxes king of
Persia, Ezra went up from
Babylon; and he was a ready scribe
in the law of Moses: and the king
granted him all his request, according
to the hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God
upon him.</div>

<p>Now this is the copy of the letter
that the king Artaxerxes gave unto
Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a
scribe of the words of the commandments
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and of his statutes
to Israel. Artaxerxes, king of kings,
unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the
law of the God of heaven, perfect
peace. I make a decree, that all they
of the people of Israel, and of his
priests and Levites, in my realm,
which are minded of their own freewill
to go up to Jerusalem, go with
thee. Forasmuch as thou art sent of
the king, and of his seven counsellors,
to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem,
according to the law of thy
God which is in thine hand; and to
carry the silver and gold, which the
king and his counsellors have freely
offered unto the God of Israel, whose
habitation is in Jerusalem, and all
the silver and gold that thou canst
find in all the province of Babylon,
with the freewill offering of the people,
and of the priests, offering willingly
for the house of their God
which is in Jerusalem: that thou mayest
buy speedily with this money bullocks,
rams, lambs, with their meat
offerings and their drink offerings,
and offer them upon the altar of the
house of your God which is in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>And whatsoever shall seem good to
thee, and to thy brethren, to do with
the rest of the silver and the gold,
that do after the will of your God.
The vessels also that are given thee
for the service of the house of thy
God, those deliver thou before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
God of Jerusalem. And whatsoever
more shall be needful for the house
of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion
to bestow, bestow it out of the
king's treasure house. And I, even I
Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree
to all the treasurers which are
beyond the river, that whatsoever
Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law
of the God of heaven, shall require of
you, it be done speedily, unto an hundred
talents of silver, and to an hundred
measures of wheat, and to an
hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred
baths of oil, and salt without
prescribing how much. Whatsoever
is commanded by the God of heaven,
let it be diligently done for the house
of the God of heaven: for why should
there be wrath against the realm of
the king and his sons? Also we certify
you, that touching any of the
ministers of this house of God, it shall
not be lawful to impose toll, tribute,
or custom, upon them. And thou,
Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God,
that is in thine hand, set magistrates
and judges, which may judge all the
people that are beyond the river, all
such as know the laws of thy God;
and teach ye them that know them
not. And whosoever will not do the
law of thy God, and the law of
the king, let judgment be executed
speedily upon him, whether it be
unto death, or to banishment, or to
confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ezra 8</div>

<p>Blessed be the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of our fathers,
which hath put such a thing as
this in the king's heart, to beautify
the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> which is in Jerusalem:
and hath extended mercy
unto me before the king, and his counsellors,
and before all the king's
mighty princes. And I was strengthened
as the hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my God
was upon me, and I gathered together
out of Israel chief men to go up with
me. And I gathered them together
to the river that runneth to Ahava;
and there abode we in tents three
days. Then I proclaimed a fast there,
at the river of Ahava, that we might
afflict ourselves before our God, to
seek of him a right way for us, and
for our little ones, and for all our substance.
For I was ashamed to require
of the king a band of soldiers and
horsemen to help us against the enemy
in the way: because we had
spoken unto the king, saying, The
hand of our God is upon all them for
good that seek him; but his power and
his wrath is against all them that forsake
him. So we fasted and besought
our God for this: and he was intreated
of us.</p>

<p>Then we departed from the river
of Ahava on the twelfth day of the
first month, to go unto Jerusalem:
and the hand of our God was upon us,
and he delivered us from the hand of
the enemy, and of such as lay in wait
by the way. And we came to Jerusalem,
and abode there three days.
Now on the fourth day was the silver
and the gold and the vessels weighed
in the house of our God, by number
and by weight of every one: and all
the weight was written at that time.
Also the children of those that had
been carried away, which were come
out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings
unto the God of Israel. And
they delivered the king's commissions
unto the king's lieutenants, and to the
governors on this side the river: and
they furthered the people, and the
house of God.</p>

<small>THE BUILDING OF JERUSALEM</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Nehemiah 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE words of Nehemiah the son
of Hachaliah. And it came to
pass in the month Chisleu, in
the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan
the palace, that Hanani, one of
my brethren, came, he and certain
men of Judah; and I asked them concerning
the Jews that had escaped,
which were left of the captivity, and
concerning Jerusalem. And they
said unto me, The remnant that are
left of the captivity there in the province
are in great affliction and reproach:
the wall of Jerusalem also
is broken down, and the gates thereof
are burned with fire. And it came to
pass, when I heard these words, that
I sat down and wept, and mourned
certain days, and fasted, and prayed
before the God of heaven, and said, I
beseech thee, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of heaven,
the great and terrible God, that keepeth
covenant and mercy for them that
love him and observe his commandments:
let thine ear now be attentive,
and thine eyes open, that thou mayest
hear the prayer of thy servant, which
I pray before thee now, day and
night, for the children of Israel thy
servants, and confess the sins of the
children of Israel, which we have
sinned against thee: both I and my
father's house have sinned. We have
dealt very corruptly against thee, and
have not kept the commandments, nor
the statutes, nor the judgments, which
thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</div>

<p>Remember, I beseech thee, the
word that thou commandedst thy servant
Moses, saying, If ye transgress,
I will scatter you abroad among the
nations: but if ye turn unto me, and
keep my commandments, and do
them; though there were of you cast
out unto the uttermost part of the
heaven, yet will I gather them from
thence, and will bring them unto the
place that I have chosen to set my
name there. Now these are thy servants
and thy people, whom thou hast
redeemed by thy great power, and
by thy strong hand. O Lord, I beseech
thee, let now thine ear be attentive
to the prayer of thy servant, and
to the prayer of thy servants, who desire
to fear thy name: and prosper, I
pray thee, thy servant this day, and
grant him mercy in the sight of this
man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</p>

<p>And it came to pass in the month
Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes
the king, that wine was before
him: and I took up the wine,
and gave it unto the king. Now I had
not been beforetime sad in his presence.
Wherefore the king said unto
me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing
thou art not sick? this is nothing
else but sorrow of heart. Then I was
very sore afraid, and said unto the
king, Let the king live for ever: why
should not my countenance be sad,
when the city, the place of my fathers'
sepulchres, lieth waste, and the
gates thereof are consumed with fire?
Then the king said unto me, For what
dost thou make request? So I prayed
to the God of heaven. And I said
unto the king, If it please the king,
and if thy servant have found favour
in thy sight, that thou wouldest send
me unto Judah, unto the city of my
fathers' sepulchres, that I may build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
it. And the king said unto me, (the
queen also sitting by him,) For how
long shall thy journey be? and when
wilt thou return? So it pleased the
king to send me; and I set him a time.
Moreover I said unto the king, If it
please the king, let letters be given
me to the governors beyond the river,
that they may convey me over till I
come into Judah; and a letter unto
Asaph the keeper of the king's forest,
that he may give me timber to make
beams for the gates of the palace
which appertained to the house, and
for the wall of the city, and for the
house that I shall enter into. And
the king granted me, according to the
good hand of my God upon me.</p>

<p>Then I came to the governors beyond
the river, and gave them the
king's letters. Now the king had sent
captains of the army and horsemen
with me. So I came to Jerusalem,
and was there three days. And I
arose in the night, I and some few
men with me; neither told I any man
what my God had put in my heart to
do at Jerusalem: neither was there
any beast with me, save the beast that
I rode upon. And I went out by night
by the gate of the valley, and viewed
the walls of Jerusalem, which were
broken down, and the gates thereof
were consumed with fire. And the
rulers knew not whither I went, or
what I did; neither had I as yet told
it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor
to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor
to the rest that did the work.</p>

<p>Then said I unto them, Ye see the
distress that we are in, how Jerusalem
lieth waste, and the gates thereof are
burned with fire: come, and let us
build up the wall of Jerusalem, that
we be no more a reproach. Then I
told them of the hand of my God
which was good upon me; as also the
king's words that he had spoken unto
me. And they said, Let us rise up
and build. So they strengthened their
hands for this good work. But when
Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah
the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem
the Arabian, heard it, they
laughed us to scorn, and despised us,
and said, What is this thing that ye
do? will ye rebel against the king?
Then answered I them, and said unto
them, The God of heaven, he will
prosper us; therefore we his servants
will arise and build.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nehemiah 4</div>

<p>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat
heard that we builded the wall,
he was wroth, and took great indignation,
and mocked the Jews. And he
spake before his brethren and the
army of Samaria, and said, What do
these feeble Jews? will they fortify
themselves? will they sacrifice? will
they make an end in a day? will they
revive the stones out of the heaps of
the rubbish which are burned? Now
Tobiah the Ammonite was by him,
and he said, Even that which they
build, if a fox go up, he shall even
break down their stone wall. Hear,
O our God; for we are despised: and
turn their reproach upon their own
head, and give them for a prey in the
land of captivity: and cover not their
iniquity, and let not their sin be
blotted out from before thee: for they
have provoked thee to anger before
the builders. So built we the wall;
and all the wall was joined together
unto the half thereof: for the people
had a mind to work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nehemiah 6</div>

<p>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat,
and Tobiah, and the Arabians,
and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
heard that the walls of Jerusalem
were made up, and that the
breaches began to be stopped, then
they were very wroth, and conspired
all of them together to come and to
fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder
it. Nevertheless we made our
prayer unto our God, and set a watch
against them day and night, because
of them. And Judah said, The
strength of the bearers of burdens
is decayed, and there is much rubbish;
so that we are not able to build
the wall. And our adversaries said,
They shall not know, neither see, till
we come in the midst among them,
and slay them, and cause the work to
cease. And it came to pass, that when
the Jews which dwelt by them came,
they said unto us ten times, From all
places whence ye shall return unto
us they will be upon you.</p>

<p>Therefore set I in the lower places
behind the wall, and on the higher
places, I even set the people after
their families with their swords, their
spears, and their bows. And I looked,
and rose up, and said unto the nobles,
and to the rulers, and to the rest of
the people, Be not ye afraid of them:
remember the Lord, which is great
and terrible, and fight for your brethren,
your sons, and your daughters,
your wives, and your houses.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when our enemies
heard that it was known unto us,
and God had brought their counsel
to nought, that we returned all of us
to the wall, every one unto his work.
And it came to pass from that time
forth, that the half of my servants
wrought in the work, and the other
half of them held both the spears, the
shields, and the bows, and the habergeons;
and the rulers were behind all
the house of Judah. They which
builded on the wall, and they that
bare burdens, with those that laded,
every one with one of his hands
wrought in the work, and with the
other hand held a weapon. For the
builders, every one had his sword
girded by his side, and so builded.
And he that sounded the trumpet was
by me. And I said unto the nobles,
and to the rulers, and to the rest of
the people, The work is great and
large, and we are separated upon the
wall, one far from another. In what
place therefore ye hear the sound of
the trumpet, resort ye thither unto
us: our God shall fight for us.</p>

<p>So we laboured in the work: and
half of them held the spears from the
rising of the morning till the stars
appeared. So the wall was finished
in the twenty and fifth day of the
month Elul, in fifty and two days.
And it came to pass, that when all our
enemies heard thereof, and all the
heathen that were about us saw these
things, they were much cast down in
their own eyes: for they perceived
that this work was wrought of our
God.</p>

<p>And all the people gathered themselves
together as one man into the
street that was before the water gate;
and they spake unto Ezra the scribe
to bring the book of the law of Moses,
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had commanded to
Israel. And Ezra the priest brought
the law before the congregation both
of men and women, and all that could
hear with understanding, upon the
first day of the seventh month. And
he read therein before the street that
was before the water gate from the
morning until midday, before the men
and the women, and those that could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
understand; and the ears of all the
people were attentive unto the book
of the law. And Ezra the scribe stood
upon a pulpit of wood, which they
had made for the purpose. And Ezra
opened the book in the sight of all
the people; (for he was above all the
people;) and when he opened it, all
the people stood up: and Ezra blessed
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the great God. And all the
people answered, Amen, Amen, with
lifting up their hands: and they
bowed their heads, and worshipped
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> with their faces to the
ground.</p>

<p>And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha,
and Ezra the priest the scribe,
and the Levites that taught the people,
said unto all the people, This day
is holy unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your God;
mourn not, nor weep. For all the
people wept, when they heard the
words of the law. Then he said unto
them, Go your way, eat the fat, and
drink the sweet, and send portions
unto them for whom nothing is prepared:
for this day is holy unto our
Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the
joy of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is your strength.</p>

<p>And the rulers of the people dwelt
at Jerusalem: the rest of the people
also cast lots, to bring one of ten to
dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and
nine parts to dwell in other cities.
And the people blessed all the men,
that willingly offered themselves to
dwell at Jerusalem. And at the dedication
of the wall of Jerusalem they
sought the Levites out of all their
places, to bring them to Jerusalem,
to keep the dedication with gladness,
both with thanksgivings, and with
singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and
with harps. And the sons of the
singers gathered themselves together,
both out of the plain country round
about Jerusalem, and from the villages;
and they stood in two companies
upon the wall, the singers and
the priests with trumpets. And the
singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah
their overseer. Also that day they offered
great sacrifices, and rejoiced:
for God had made them rejoice with
great joy: the wives also and the children
rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem
was heard even afar off.</p>

<small>ESTHER'S REQUEST</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Esther 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW it came to pass in the
days of Ahasuerus, (this is
Ahasuerus which reigned,
from India even unto Ethiopia, over
an hundred and seven and twenty
provinces:) in the third year of
his reign, he made a feast unto all
his princes and his servants: when
he shewed the riches of his glorious
kingdom and the honour of his excellent
majesty many days, even an hundred
and fourscore days.</div>

<p>And when these days were expired,
the king made a feast unto all the people
that were present in Shushan
the palace, both unto great and small,
seven days, in the court of the garden
of the king's palace; where were
white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened
with cords of fine linen and
purple to silver rings and pillars of
marble: the beds were of gold and silver,
upon a pavement of red, and
blue, and white, and black, marble.
And they gave them drink in vessels
of gold, (the vessels being diverse one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
from another,) and royal wine in
abundance, according to the state of
the king. Also Vashti the queen
made a feast for the women in the
royal house which belonged to king
Ahasuerus.</p>

<p>On the seventh day, when the heart
of the king was merry with wine, he
commanded the seven chamberlains
to bring Vashti the queen before the
king with the crown royal, to shew
the people and the princes her
beauty: for she was fair to look on.
But the queen Vashti refused to come
at the king's commandment by his
chamberlains: therefore was the king
very wroth, and his anger burned in
him. Then the king said to the wise
men, which knew the times, What
shall we do unto the queen Vashti
according to law, because she hath not
performed the commandment of the
king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
And Memucan answered before the
king and the princes, If it please the
king, let there go a royal commandment
from him, and let it be written
among the laws of the Persians and
the Medes, that it be not altered, That
Vashti come no more before king
Ahasuerus; and let the king give her
royal estate unto another that is better
than she.</p>

<p>And the saying pleased the king
and the princes; and the king did according
to the word of Memucan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Esther 2</div>

<p>Then said the king's servants that
ministered unto him, Let there be fair
young virgins sought for the king:
and let the maiden which pleaseth the
king be queen instead of Vashti.
And the thing pleased the king; and
he did so.</p>

<p>Now in Shushan the palace there
was a certain Jew, whose name was
Mordecai, who had been carried away
from Jerusalem with the captivity
which had been carried away with
Jeconiah [Jehoiachin] king of Judah,
whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of
Babylon had carried away. And he
brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther,
his uncle's daughter: for she had neither
father nor mother, and the maid
was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai,
when her father and mother
were dead, took for his own daughter.</p>

<p>So it came to pass, when the king's
commandment and his decree was
heard, and when many maidens were
gathered together unto Shushan the
palace, that Esther was brought also
unto the king's house, to the custody
of Hegai, keeper of the women. And
the maiden pleased him, and she obtained
kindness of him: and he preferred
her and her maids unto the
best place of the house of the women.
Esther had not shewed her people
nor her kindred: for Mordecai had
charged her that she should not shew
it. And Mordecai walked every day
before the court of the women's
house, to know how Esther did, and
what should become of her.</p>

<p>Now when every maid's turn was
come to go in to king Ahasuerus,
whatsoever she desired was given her
to go with her out of the house of the
women unto the king's house. Now
when the turn of Esther was come,
she required nothing but what the
king's chamberlain appointed. And
Esther obtained favour in the sight of
all them that looked upon her. So
Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus
into his house royal in the
tenth month, which is the month Tebeth,
in the seventh year of his reign.</p>

<p>And the king loved Esther above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
all the women, and she obtained grace
and favour in his sight more than
all the virgins; so that he set the
royal crown upon her head, and made
her queen instead of Vashti. Then
the king made a great feast unto all
his princes and his servants, even
Esther's feast; and he made a release
to the provinces, and gave gifts, according
to the state of the king.</p>

<p>In those days, while Mordecai sat
in the king's gate, two of the king's
chamberlains, of those which kept the
door, were wroth, and sought to lay
hand on the king Ahasuerus. And the
thing was known to Mordecai, who
told it unto Esther the queen; and
Esther certified the king thereof in
Mordecai's name. And when inquisition
was made of the matter, it was
found out; therefore they were both
hanged on a tree: and it was written
in the book of the chronicles before
the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Esther 3</div>

<p>After these things did king Ahasuerus
promote Haman the Agagite,
and advanced him, and set his seat
above all the princes that were with
him. And all the king's servants,
that were in the king's gate, bowed,
and reverenced Haman: for the king
had so commanded concerning him.
But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him
reverence. Then the king's servants,
which were in the king's gate, said
unto Mordecai, Why transgressest
thou the king's commandment?</p>

<p>Now it came to pass, when they
spake daily unto him, and he hearkened
not unto them, that they told
Haman, to see whether Mordecai's
matters would stand: for he had told
them that he was a Jew. And when
Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not,
nor did him reverence, then was Haman
full of wrath. And he thought
scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone;
for they had shewed him the people
of Mordecai: wherefore Haman
sought to destroy all the Jews that
were throughout the whole kingdom
of Ahasuerus, even the people of
Mordecai.</p>

<p>And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus,
There is a certain people scattered
abroad and dispersed among
the people in all the provinces of
thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse
from all people; neither keep
they the king's laws: therefore it is
not for the king's profit to suffer
them. If it please the king, let it be
written that they may be destroyed:
and I will pay ten thousand talents of
silver to the hands of those that have
the charge of the business, to bring
it into the king's treasuries.</p>

<p>And the king took his ring from his
hand, and gave it unto Haman, the
Jews' enemy. And the king said unto
Haman, The silver is given to thee,
the people also, to do with them as it
seemeth good to thee.</p>

<p>Then were the king's scribes called
on the thirteenth day of the first
month, and there was written according
to all that Haman had commanded
unto the king's lieutenants,
and to the governors that were over
every province; in the name of king
Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed
with the king's ring. And the letters
were sent by posts into all the king's
provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to
cause to perish, all Jews, both young
and old, little children and women, in
one day, even upon the thirteenth day
of the twelfth month, which is the
month Adar, and to take the spoil of
them for a prey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The posts went out, being hastened
by the king's commandment, and the
decree was given in Shushan the palace.
And the king and Haman sat
down to drink; but the city Shushan
was perplexed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Esther 4</div>

<p>When Mordecai perceived all that
was done, Mordecai rent his clothes,
and put on sackcloth with ashes, and
went out into the midst of the city,
and cried with a loud and a bitter
cry; and came even before the king's
gate: for none might enter into the
king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
And in every province, whithersoever
the king's commandment and his decree
came, there was great mourning
among the Jews, and fasting, and
weeping, and wailing; and many lay
in sackcloth and ashes.</p>

<p>So Esther's maids and her chamberlains
came and told it her. Then
was the queen exceedingly grieved;
and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai,
and to take away his sackcloth
from him: but he received it not.
Then called Esther for Hatach, one
of the king's chamberlains, whom he
had appointed to attend upon her, and
gave him a commandment to Mordecai,
to know what it was, and why it
was. So Hatach went forth to Mordecai
unto the street of the city, which
was before the king's gate.</p>

<p>And Mordecai told him of all that
had happened unto him, and of the
sum of the money that Haman had
promised to pay to the king's treasuries
for the Jews, to destroy them.
Also he gave him the copy of the writing
of the decree that was given at
Shushan to destroy them, to shew it
unto Esther, and to declare it unto
her, and to charge her that she should
go in unto the king, to make supplication
unto him, and to make request
before him for her people. And Hatach
came and told Esther the words
of Mordecai.</p>

<p>Again Esther spake unto Hatach,
and gave him commandment unto
Mordecai; All the king's servants,
and the people of the king's provinces,
do know, that whosoever,
whether man or woman, shall come
unto the king into the inner court,
who is not called, there is one law
of his to put him to death, except such
to whom the king shall hold out the
golden sceptre, that he may live: but
I have not been called to come in unto
the king these thirty days.</p>

<p>And they told to Mordecai Esther's
words. Then Mordecai commanded
to answer Esther, Think not with thyself
that thou shalt escape in the
king's house, more than all the Jews.
For if thou altogether holdest thy
peace at this time, then shall there
enlargement and deliverance arise to
the Jews from another place; but thou
and thy father's house shall be destroyed:
and who knoweth whether
thou art come to the kingdom for such
a time as this?</p>

<p>Then Esther bade them return
Mordecai this answer, Go, gather together
all the Jews that are present
in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and
neither eat nor drink three days,
night or day: I also and my maidens
will fast likewise; and so will I go in
unto the king, which is not according
to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
So Mordecai went his way, and did
according to all that Esther had commanded
him.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass on the third
day, that Esther put on her royal apparel,
and stood in the inner court of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the king's house, over against the
king's house: and the king sat upon
his royal throne in the royal house,
over against the gate of the house.
And it was so, when the king saw Esther
the queen standing in the court,
that she obtained favour in his sight:
and the king held out to Esther the
golden sceptre that was in his hand.
So Esther drew near, and touched the
top of the sceptre.</p>

<p>Then said the king unto her, What
wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is
thy request? it shall be even given
thee to the half of the kingdom. And
Esther answered, If it seem good
unto the king, let the king and Haman
come this day unto the banquet that
I have prepared for him. Then the
king said, Cause Haman to make
haste, that he may do as Esther hath
said. So the king and Haman came
to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</p>

<p>And the king said unto Esther at
the banquet of wine, What is thy petition?
and it shall be granted thee:
and what is thy request? even to the
half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
Then answered Esther, and
said, My petition and my request is;
If I have found favour in the sight of
the king, and if it please the king to
grant my petition, and to perform my
request, let the king and Haman come
to the banquet that I shall prepare
for them, and I will do to morrow as
the king hath said.</p>

<p>Then went Haman forth that day
joyful and with a glad heart: but
when Haman saw Mordecai in the
king's gate, that he stood not up, nor
moved for him, he was full of indignation
against Mordecai. Nevertheless
Haman refrained himself: and
when he came home, he sent and
called for his friends, and Zeresh his
wife. And Haman told them of the
glory of his riches, and the multitude
of his children, and all the things
wherein the king had promoted him,
and how he had advanced him above
the princes and servants of the king.
Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther
the queen did let no man come in with
the king unto the banquet that she
had prepared but myself; and to morrow
am I invited unto her also with
the king. Yet all this availeth me nothing,
so long as I see Mordecai the
Jew sitting at the king's gate.</p>

<p>Then said Zeresh his wife and all
his friends unto him, Let a gallows be
made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow
speak thou unto the king that
Mordecai may be hanged thereon:
then go thou in merrily with the king
unto the banquet. And the thing
pleased Haman; and he caused the
gallows to be made.</p>

<small>THE ADVANCEMENT OF
MORDECAI</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Esther 6</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>ON that night could not the
king sleep, and he commanded
to bring the book of
records of the chronicles; and they
were read before the king. And it
was found written, that Mordecai had
told of two of the king's chamberlains,
the keepers of the door, who
sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
And the king said, What
honour and dignity hath been done
to Mordecai for this? Then said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
king's servants that ministered unto
him, There is nothing done for him.
And the king said, Who is in the
court? Now Haman was come into
the outward court of the king's house,
to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai
on the gallows that he had prepared
for him. And the king's servants
said unto him, Behold, Haman
standeth in the court. And the king
said, Let him come in. So Haman
came in. And the king said unto him,
What shall be done unto the man
whom the king delighteth to honour?
Now Haman thought in his heart, To
whom would the king delight to do
honour more than to myself? And
Haman answered the king, For the
man whom the king delighteth to honour,
let the royal apparel be brought
which the king useth to wear, and the
horse that the king rideth upon, and
the crown royal which is set upon his
head: and let this apparel and horse
be delivered to the hand of one of the
king's most noble princes, that they
may array the man withal whom the
king delighteth to honour, and bring
him on horseback through the street
of the city, and proclaim before him,
Thus shall it be done to the man whom
the king delighteth to honour. Then
the king said to Haman, Make haste,
and take the apparel and the horse,
as thou hast said, and do even so to
Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the
king's gate: let nothing fail of all that
thou hast spoken. Then took Haman
the apparel and the horse, and arrayed
Mordecai, and brought him on
horseback through the street of the
city, and proclaimed before him, Thus
shall it be done unto the man whom
the king delighteth to honour.</div>

<p>And Mordecai came again to the
king's gate. But Haman hasted to
his house mourning, and having his
head covered. And Haman told Zeresh
his wife and all his friends every
thing that had befallen him. Then
said his wise men and Zeresh his wife
unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed
of the Jews, before whom thou hast
begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail
against him, but shalt surely fall before
him. And while they were yet
talking with him, came the king's
chamberlains, and hasted to bring
Haman unto the banquet that Esther
had prepared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Esther 7</div>

<p>So the king and Haman came to
banquet with Esther the queen. And
the king said again unto Esther on
the second day at the banquet of wine,
What is thy petition, queen Esther?
and it shall be granted thee: and what
is thy request? and it shall be performed,
even to the half of the kingdom.
Then Esther the queen answered
and said, If I have found
favour in thy sight, O king, and if it
please the king, let my life be given
me at my petition, and my people at
my request: for we are sold, I and my
people, to be destroyed, to be slain,
and to perish.</p>

<p>Then the king Ahasuerus answered
and said unto Esther the queen, Who
is he, and where is he, that durst presume
in his heart to do so? And Esther
said, The adversary and enemy
is this wicked Haman. Then Haman
was afraid before the king and the
queen. And Harbonah, one of the
chamberlains, said before the king,
Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits
high, which Haman had made for
Mordecai, who had spoken good for
the king, standeth in the house of Haman.
Then the king said, Hang him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
thereon. So they hanged Haman on
the gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai. Then was the king's
wrath pacified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Esther 8</div>

<p>On that day did the king Ahasuerus
give the house of Haman the Jews'
enemy unto Esther the queen. And
Mordecai came before the king; for
Esther had told what he was unto her.
And the king took off his ring, which
he had taken from Haman, and gave
it unto Mordecai. And Esther set
Mordecai over the house of Haman.</p>

<p>And Esther spake yet again before
the king, and fell down at his feet, and
besought him with tears to put away
the mischief of Haman the Agagite,
and his device that he had devised
against the Jews. Then the king held
out the golden sceptre toward Esther.
So Esther arose, and stood before the
king, and said, If it please the king,
and if I have found favour in his
sight, and the thing seem right before
the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes,
let it be written to reverse the letters
devised by Haman, which he wrote
to destroy the Jews which are in all
the king's provinces: for how can I
endure to see the evil that shall come
unto my people? or how can I endure
to see the destruction of my kindred?
Then the king Ahasuerus said unto
Esther the queen and to Mordecai the
Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the
house of Haman, and him they have
hanged upon the gallows, because he
laid his hand upon the Jews. Write
ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you,
in the king's name, and seal it with
the king's ring: for the writing which
is written in the king's name, and
sealed with the king's ring, may no
man reverse. Then were the king's
scribes called. And Mordecai wrote
in the king Ahasuerus' name, and
sealed it with the king's ring, and sent
letters by posts on horseback, and
riders on mules, camels, and young
dromedaries: wherein the king granted
the Jews which were in every city
to gather themselves together, and to
stand for their life, to destroy, to slay,
and to cause to perish, all the power
of the people and province that would
assault them, both little ones and women,
and to take the spoil of them for
a prey, upon one day in all the provinces
of king Ahasuerus, namely,
upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month, which is the month Adar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Esther 9</div>

<p>And Mordecai went out from the
presence of the king in royal apparel
of blue and white, and with a great
crown of gold, and with a garment of
fine linen and purple: and the city of
Shushan rejoiced and was glad. The
Jews had light, and gladness, and joy,
and honour. And in every province,
and in every city, whithersoever the
king's commandment and his decree
came, the Jews had joy and gladness,
a feast and a good day. And
many of the people of the land became
Jews; for the fear of the Jews
fell upon them.</p>

<p>And in Shushan the palace the
Jews slew and destroyed five hundred
men. And the king said unto
Esther the queen, The Jews have
slain and destroyed five hundred men
in Shushan the palace; now what is
thy petition? and it shall be granted
thee: or what is thy request further?
and it shall be done. Then said Esther,
If it please the king, let it be
granted to the Jews which are in
Shushan to do to morrow also according
unto this day's decree, and let Haman's
ten sons be hanged upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
gallows. And the king commanded
it so to be done: and the decree was
given at Shushan; and they hanged
Haman's ten sons.</p>

<p>And Mordecai wrote these things,
and sent letters unto all the Jews that
were in all the provinces of the king
Ahasuerus, both nigh and far, to
stablish this among them, that they
should keep the fourteenth day of the
month Adar, and the fifteenth day
of the same, yearly, as the days
wherein the Jews rested from their
enemies, and the month which was
turned unto them from sorrow to joy,
and from mourning into a good day:
that they should make them days of
feasting and joy, and of sending portions
one to another, and gifts to the
poor. Because Haman, the enemy of
all the Jews, had cast Pur, that is, the
lot, to consume them, and to destroy
them: wherefore they called these
days Purim after the name of Pur.</p>

<p>And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute
upon the land, and upon the isles
of the sea. And all the acts of his
power and of his might, and the declaration
of the greatness of Mordecai,
whereunto the king advanced him,
are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Media and
Persia? For Mordecai the Jew was
next unto king Ahasuerus, and great
among the Jews, and accepted of the
multitude of his brethren, seeking the
wealth of his people, and speaking
peace to all his seed.</p>

<small>JOB SMITTEN</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="150" height="176" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THERE was a man
in the land of Uz,
whose name was
Job; and that
man was perfect
and upright, and
one that feared
God, and eschewed
evil. And there
were born unto him seven sons and
three daughters. His substance also
was seven thousand sheep, and three
thousand camels, and five hundred
yoke of oxen, and five hundred she
asses, and a very great household; so
that this man was the greatest of all
the men of the east. And his sons
went and feasted in their houses,
every one his day; and sent and
called for their three sisters to eat and
to drink with them. And it was so,
when the days of their feasting were
gone about, that Job sent and sanctified
them, and rose up early in the
morning, and offered burnt offerings
according to the number of them all:
for Job said, It may be that my sons
have sinned, and cursed God in their
hearts. Thus did Job continually.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Job 2</div>

<p>Now there was a day when the sons
of God came to present themselves
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and Satan came also
among them. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto
Satan, Whence comest thou? Then
Satan answered the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said,
From going to and fro in the earth,
and from walking up and down in it.
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Satan, Hast
thou considered my servant Job, that
there is none like him in the earth, a
perfect and an upright man, one that
feareth God, and escheweth evil?
Then Satan answered the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
Hast not thou made an hedge about
him, and about his house, and about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
all that he hath on every side? thou
hast blessed the work of his hands,
and his substance is increased in the
land. But put forth thine hand now,
and touch all that he hath, and he will
curse thee to thy face. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
said unto Satan, Behold, all that he
hath is in thy power; only upon himself
put not forth thine hand. So
Satan went forth from the presence
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>And there was a day when his sons
and his daughters were eating and
drinking wine in their eldest brother's
house: and there came a messenger
unto Job, and said, The oxen
were plowing, and the asses feeding
beside them: and the Sabeans fell
upon them, and took them away; yea,
they have slain the servants with the
edge of the sword; and I only am escaped
alone to tell thee. While he
was yet speaking, there came also another,
and said, The fire of God is
fallen from heaven, and hath burned
up the sheep, and the servants, and
consumed them; and I only am escaped
alone to tell thee. While he
was yet speaking, there came also
another, and said, The Chaldeans
made out three bands, and fell upon
the camels, and have carried them
away, yea, and slain the servants with
the edge of the sword; and I only am
escaped alone to tell thee. While he
was yet speaking, there came also another,
and said, Thy sons and thy
daughters were eating and drinking
wine in their eldest brother's house:
and, behold, there came a great wind
from the wilderness, and smote the
four corners of the house, and it fell
upon the young men, and they are
dead; and I only am escaped alone to
tell thee. Then Job arose, and rent
his mantle, and shaved his head, and
fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
and said, Naked was I born,
and naked shall I die: the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> gave,
and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath taken away;
blessed be the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. In
all this Job sinned not, nor charged
God foolishly.</p>

<p>Again there was a day when the
sons of God came to present themselves
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and Satan
came also among them. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Satan, From whence
comest thou? And Satan answered
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said, From going to
and fro in the earth, and from walking
up and down in it. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
said unto Satan, Hast thou considered
my servant Job, that there is none
like him in the earth, a perfect and
an upright man, one that feareth God,
and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth
fast his integrity, although thou
movedst me against him, to destroy
him without cause. And Satan answered
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said, Skin for
skin, yea, all that a man hath will
he give for his life. But put forth
thine hand now, and touch his bone
and his flesh, and he will curse thee to
thy face. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto
Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand;
but save his life.</p>

<p>So went Satan forth from the presence
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and smote Job with
sore boils from the sole of his foot
unto his crown. And he took him a
potsherd to scrape himself withal;
and he sat down among the ashes.
Then said his wife unto him, Dost
thou still retain thine integrity?
curse God, and die. But he said unto
her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish
women speaketh. What? shall we
receive good at the hand of God, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
shall we not receive evil? In all this
did not Job sin with his lips.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_134" id="CHAPTER_134">CHAPTER 134</a><br />

<small>JOB'S COMFORTERS</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>NOW when Job's three friends
heard of all this evil that was
come upon him, they came
every one from his own place; Eliphaz
the Temanite, and Bildad the
Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite:
for they had made an appointment
together to come to mourn with him
and to comfort him. And when they
lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew
him not, they lifted up their voice,
and wept; and they rent every one his
mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their
heads toward heaven. So they sat
down with him upon the ground seven
days and seven nights, and none
spake a word unto him: for they saw
that his grief was very great.</div>

<p>After this opened Job his mouth, and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Let the day perish wherein I was born.<br />
Why died I not from my birth?<br />
For now should I have lain still and been quiet,<br />
I should have slept: then had I been at rest,<br />
With kings and counsellors of the earth,<br />
Which built desolate places for themselves.<br />
There the wicked cease from troubling;<br />
And there the weary be at rest.<br />
There the prisoners rest together;<br />
They hear not the voice of the oppressor.<br />
The small and great are there;<br />
And the servant is free from his master.<br />
For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me,<br />
And that which I was afraid of is come unto me.<br />
I was not in safety, neither had I rest,<br />
Neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.<br />
</div>

<p>Then Eliphaz answered and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Behold, thou hast instructed many,<br />
And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.<br />
Thy words have upholden him that was falling,<br />
And thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.<br />
But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest;<br />
It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.<br />
Is not this thy fear, thy confidence,<br />
Thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?<br />
Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?<br />
Or where were the righteous cut off?<br />
Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,<br />
And sow wickedness, reap the same.<br />
By the blast of God they perish,<br />
And by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.<br />
Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust,<br />
Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;<br />
Yet man is born unto trouble,<br />
As the sparks fly upward.<br />
I would seek unto God,<br />
And unto God would I commit my cause:<br />
Which doeth great things and unsearchable;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>Marvellous things without number:<br />
Who giveth rain upon the earth,<br />
And sendeth waters upon the fields:<br />
To set up on high those that be low;<br />
That those which mourn may be exalted to safety.<br />
So the poor hath hope,<br />
And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.<br />
Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth:<br />
Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:<br />
For he maketh sore, and bindeth up:<br />
He woundeth, and his hands make whole.<br />
He shall deliver thee in six troubles:<br />
Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.<br />
In famine he shall redeem thee from death:<br />
And in war from the power of the sword.<br />
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue:<br />
Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.<br />
At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh:<br />
Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.<br />
For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field:<br />
And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.<br />
And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace;<br />
And thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.<br />
Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,<br />
And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.<br />
Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age,<br />
Like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.<br />
Lo this, we have searched it, so it is;<br />
Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.<br />
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Job 6</div>

<p>But Job answered and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Oh that my grief were throughly weighed,<br />
And my calamity laid in the balances together!<br />
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:<br />
Therefore my words are swallowed up.<br />
Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?<br />
Or loweth the ox over his fodder?<br />
Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt?<br />
Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?<br />
The things that my soul refused to touch<br />
Are as my sorrowful meat.<br />
Oh that I might have my request;<br />
And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!<br />
Even that it would please God to destroy me;<br />
That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!<br />
Then should I yet have comfort;<br />
Yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare;<br />
For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.<br />
What is my strength, that I should hope?<br />
And what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?<br />
To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend;<br />
But he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.<br />
Teach me, and I will hold my tongue:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.<br />
</div>
<div class="sidenote">Job 7</div>

<div class='poem'>O remember that my life is wind:<br />
Mine eye shall no more see good.<br />
The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more:<br />
Thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.<br />
As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away:<br />
So he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.<br />
He shall return no more to his house,<br />
Neither shall his place know him any more.<br />
Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;<br />
I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;<br />
I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.<br />
What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him?<br />
And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?<br />
And that thou shouldest visit him every morning,<br />
And try him every moment?<br />
I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?<br />
Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee,<br />
So that I am a burden to myself?<br />
And why dost thou not pardon my transgression,<br />
And take away mine iniquity?<br />
For now shall I sleep in the dust;<br />
And thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.<br />
</div>

<p>Then answered Bildad, and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
How long wilt thou speak these things?<br />
And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?<br />
Doth God pervert judgment?<br />
Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?<br />
If thy children have sinned against him,<br />
And he have cast them away for their transgression;<br />
If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes,<br />
And make thy supplication to the Almighty;<br />
If thou wert pure and upright;<br />
Surely now he would awake for thee,<br />
And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.<br />
Though thy beginning was small,<br />
Yet thy latter end should greatly increase.<br />
Can the rush grow up without mire?<br />
Can the flag grow without water?<br />
Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down,<br />
It withereth before any other herb.<br />
So are the paths of all that forget God;<br />
And the hypocrite's hope shall perish:<br />
Whose hope shall be cut off,<br />
And whose trust shall be a spider's web.<br />
He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand:<br />
He shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.<br />
He is green before the sun,<br />
And his branch shooteth forth in his garden.<br />
His roots are wrapped about the heap,<br />
And seeth the place of stones.<br />
If he destroy him from his place,<br />
Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.<br />
Behold, this is the joy of his way,<br />
And out of the earth shall others grow.<br />
Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man,<br />
Neither will he help the evil doers.<br />

<div class="sidenote">Job 9</div>

<p>Then Job answered and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
I know it is so of a truth:<br />
But how should man be just with God?<br />
If he will contend with him,<br />
He cannot answer him one of a thousand.<br />
He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:<br />
Who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?<br />
Which removeth the mountains, and they know not:<br />
Which overturneth them in his anger.<br />
Which shaketh the earth out of her place,<br />
And the pillars thereof tremble.<br />
Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not;<br />
And sealeth up the stars.<br />
Which alone spreadeth out the heavens,<br />
And treadeth upon the waves of the sea.<br />
Which doeth great things past finding out;<br />
Yea, and wonders without number.<br />
Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not:<br />
He passeth on also, but I perceive him not.<br />
Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him?<br />
Who will say unto him, What doest thou?<br />
How much less shall I answer him,<br />
And choose out my words to reason with him?<br />
Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer,<br />
But I would make supplication to my judge.<br />
If I had called, and he had answered me;<br />
Yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.<br />
For he breaketh me with a tempest,<br />
And multiplieth my wounds without cause.<br />
He will not suffer me to take my breath,<br />
But filleth me with bitterness.<br />
If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong:<br />
And if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?<br />
If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me:<br />
If I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.<br />
This is one thing, therefore I said it,<br />
He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.<br />
</div>

<p>Then answered Zophar, and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Should not the multitude of words be answered?<br />
And should a man full of talk be justified?<br />
Should thy lies make men hold their peace?<br />
And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?<br />
For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure,<br />
And I am clean in thine eyes.<br />
But oh that God would speak,<br />
And open his lips against thee:<br />
And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom,<br />
That they are double to that which is!<br />
Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.<br />
Canst thou by searching find out God?<br />
Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?<br />
It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do?<br />
Deeper than hell; what canst thou know?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>The measure thereof is longer than the earth,<br />
And broader than the sea.<br />
For he knoweth vain men:<br />
He seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?<br />
For vain man would be wise,<br />
Though man be born like a wild ass's colt.<br />
If thou prepare thine heart,<br />
And stretch out thine hands toward him;<br />
If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away,<br />
And let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.<br />
For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot;<br />
Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:<br />
Because thou shalt forget thy misery,<br />
And remember it as waters that pass away:<br />
And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday;<br />
Thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.<br />
And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope;<br />
Yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.<br />
Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;<br />
Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.<br />

<div class="sidenote">Job 12</div>

<p>And Job answered and said,</p>

No doubt but ye are the people,<br />
And wisdom shall die with you.<br />

Who calleth upon God, and he answereth him:<br />
The just upright man is laughed to scorn.<br />
But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;<br />
And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:<br />

Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again:<br />
He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.<br />
Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up:<br />

</div><div class="sidenote">Job 13</div>
<div class='poem'>Lo, mine eye hath seen all this,<br />
Mine ear hath heard and understood it.<br />
What ye know, the same do I know also:<br />

Surely I would speak to the Almighty,<br />

But ye are forgers of lies,<br />
Ye are all physicians of no value.<br />

Man that is born of a woman<br />

<p>And Eliphaz reproved Job. And
again Job answered and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Miserable comforters are ye all.<br />
I also could speak as ye do:<br />
If your soul were in my soul's stead,<br />
I could heap up words against you,<br />
And shake mine head at you.<br />

And the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.<br />
My friends scorn me:<br />
But mine eye poureth out tears unto God.<br />
O that one might plead for a man with God,<br />
As a man pleadeth for his neighbour!<br />
</div>

<p>And Bildad reproved Job. Then</p>

<p>Job answered and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
How long will ye vex my soul,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>And break me in pieces with words?<br />
These ten times have ye reproached me:<br />
Ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.<br />
And be it indeed that I have erred,<br />
Mine error remaineth with myself.<br />
If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me,<br />
And plead against me my reproach:<br />
Know now that God hath overthrown me,<br />
And hath compassed me with his net.<br />
Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:<br />
I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.<br />
He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass,<br />
And he hath set darkness in my paths.<br />
He hath stripped me of my glory,<br />
And taken the crown from my head.<br />
He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone:<br />
And mine hope hath he removed like a tree.<br />
He hath also kindled his wrath against me,<br />
And he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.<br />
His troops come together, and raise up their way against me,<br />
And encamp round about my tabernacle.<br />
He hath put my brethren far from me,<br />
And mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.<br />
My kinsfolk have failed,<br />
And my familiar friends have forgotten me.<br />
Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;<br />
For the hand of God hath touched me.<br />
Why do ye persecute me as God,<br />
And are not satisfied with my flesh?<br />
Oh that my words were now written!<br />
Oh that they were printed in a book!<br />
That they were graven with an iron pen<br />
And lead in the rock for ever!<br />
For I know that my redeemer liveth,<br />
And that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:<br />
And though after my skin worms destroy this body,<br />
Yet in my flesh shall I see God:<br />
Whom I shall see for myself,<br />
And mine eyes shall behold, and not another;<br />
Though my reins be consumed within me.<br />
</div>
<div class="sidenote">Job 20</div>

<p>Then answered Zophar, and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Knowest thou not this of old,<br />
Since man was placed upon earth,<br />
That the triumphing of the wicked is short,<br />
And the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?<br />
He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found:<br />
Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.<br />
The eye also which saw him shall see him no more;<br />
Neither shall his place any more behold him.<br />
His children shall seek to please the poor,<br />
And his hands shall restore their goods.<br />
His bones are full of the sin of his youth,<br />
Which shall lie down with him in the dust.<br />
That which he laboured for shall he restore,<br />
And shall not swallow it down:<br />
According to his substance shall the restitution be,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>And he shall not rejoice therein.<br />
Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor;<br />
Because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;<br />
He shall flee from the iron weapon,<br />
And the bow of steel shall strike him through.<br />
The heaven shall reveal his iniquity;<br />
And the earth shall rise up against him.<br />
The increase of his house shall depart,<br />
And his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.<br />
This is the portion of a wicked man from God,<br />
And the heritage appointed unto him by God.<br />
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Job 21</div>

<p>But Job answered and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Hear diligently my speech,<br />
And let this be your consolations.<br />
Suffer me that I may speak;<br />
And after that I have spoken, mock on.<br />
Wherefore do the wicked live,<br />
Become old, yea, are mighty in power?<br />
Their seed is established in their sight with them,<br />
And their offspring before their eyes.<br />
Their houses are safe from fear,<br />
Neither is the rod of God upon them.<br />
They send forth their little ones like a flock,<br />
And their children dance.<br />
They take the timbrel and harp,<br />
And rejoice at the sound of the organ.<br />
They spend their days in wealth,<br />
And in a moment go down to the grave.<br />
Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us;<br />
For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.<br />
What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?<br />
And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?<br />
Lo, their good is not in their hand:<br />
The counsel of the wicked is far from me.<br />
How oft is the candle of the wicked put out!<br />
And how oft cometh their destruction upon them!<br />
God distributeth sorrows in his anger.<br />
They are as stubble before the wind,<br />
And as chaff that the storm carrieth away.<br />
God layeth up his iniquity for his children:<br />
He rewardeth him, and he shall know it.<br />
His eyes shall see his destruction,<br />
And he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.<br />
Have ye not asked them that go by the way?<br />
And do ye not know their tokens,<br />
That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction?<br />
They shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.<br />
Who shall declare his way to his face?<br />
And who shall repay him what he hath done?<br />
Yet shall he be brought to the grave,<br />
And shall remain in the tomb.<br />
The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him,<br />
And every man shall draw after him,<br />
As there are innumerable before him.<br />
How then comfort ye me in vain,<br />
Seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?<br />
</div>

<p>Then Eliphaz accused Job of divers
sins, and exhorted him to repentance
with promises of mercy. Then
Job answered and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>Even to day is my complaint bitter:<br />
My stroke is heavier than my groaning.<br />
Oh that I knew where I might find him!<br />
That I might come even to his seat!<br />
I would order my cause before him,<br />
And fill my mouth with arguments.<br />
I would know the words which he would answer me,<br />
And understand what he would say unto me.<br />
Will he plead against me with his great power?<br />
No; but he would put strength in me.<br />
There the righteous might dispute with him;<br />
So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.<br />
Behold, I go forward, but he is not there;<br />
And backward, but I cannot perceive him:<br />
On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:<br />
He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:<br />
But he knoweth the way that I take:<br />
When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.<br />
My foot hath held his steps,<br />
His way have I kept, and not declined.<br />
Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips;<br />
I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.<br />
But he is in one mind, and who can turn him?<br />
And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.<br />
For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me:<br />
And many such things are with him.<br />
Therefore am I troubled at his presence:<br />
When I consider, I am afraid of him.<br />
For God maketh my heart soft,<br />
And the Almighty troubleth me:<br />
Because I was not cut off before the darkness,<br />
Neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.<br />
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Job 25</div>

<p>Then Bildad replied to Job, and
Job answered and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
How hast thou helped him that is without power?<br />
How savest thou the arm that hath no strength?<br />
How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom?<br />
And how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?<br />
To whom hast thou uttered words?<br />
And whose spirit came from thee?<br />
Dead things are formed<br />
From under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.<br />
Hell is naked before him,<br />
And destruction hath no covering.<br />
He stretcheth out the north over the empty place,<br />
And hangeth the earth upon nothing.<br />
He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds;<br />
And the cloud is not rent under them.<br />
He holdeth back the face of his throne,<br />
And spreadeth his cloud upon it.<br />
He hath compassed the waters with bounds,<br />
Until the day and night come to an end.<br />
The pillars of heaven tremble<br />
And are astonished at his reproof.<br />
He divideth the sea with his power,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>And by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.<br />
By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens;<br />
His hand hath formed the crooked serpent.<br />
Lo, these are parts of his ways:<br />
But how little a portion is heard of him?<br />
But the thunder of his power who can understand?<br />
Whence then cometh wisdom?<br />
And where is the place of understanding?<br />
Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,<br />
And kept close from the fowls of the air.<br />
Destruction and death say,<br />
We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.<br />
God understandeth the way thereof,<br />
And he knoweth the place thereof.<br />
For he looketh to the ends of the earth,<br />
And seeth under the whole heaven;<br />
To make the weight for the winds;<br />
And he weigheth the waters by measure.<br />
When he made a decree for the rain,<br />
And a way for the lightning of the thunder:<br />
Then did he see it, and declare it;<br />
He prepared it, yea, and searched it out.<br />
And unto man he said,<br />
Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;<br />
And to depart from evil is understanding.<br />
</div>

<p>Moreover Job continued his parable,
and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Oh that I were as in months past,<br />
As in the days when God preserved me;<br />
When his candle shined upon my head,<br />
And when by his light I walked through darkness;<br />
As I was in the days of my youth,<br />
When the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;<br />
When the Almighty was yet with me,<br />
When my children were about me;<br />
When I washed my steps with butter,<br />
And the rock poured me out rivers of oil;<br />
When I went out to the gate through the city,<br />
When I prepared my seat in the street!<br />
The young men saw me, and hid themselves:<br />
And the aged arose, and stood up.<br />
The princes refrained talking,<br />
And laid their hand on their mouth.<br />
The nobles held their peace,<br />
And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.<br />
When the ear heard me, then it blessed me;<br />
And when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:<br />
Because I delivered the poor that cried,<br />
And the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.<br />
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me:<br />
And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.<br />
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me:<br />
My judgment was as a robe and a diadem.<br />
I was eyes to the blind,<br />
And feet was I to the lame.<br />
I was a father to the poor:<br />
And the cause which I knew not I searched out.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,<br />
Whose fathers I would have disdained<br />
To have set with the dogs of my flock.<br />
I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me:<br />
I stand up, and thou regardest me not.<br />
Thou art become cruel to me:<br />
With thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.<br />
Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it,<br />
And dissolvest my substance.<br />
For I know that thou wilt bring me to death,<br />
And to the house appointed for all living.<br />
Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave,<br />
Though they cry in his destruction.<br />
Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?<br /></div>
<div class="sidenote">Job 31</div>
<div class='poem'>
Was not my soul grieved for the poor?<br />
When I looked for good, then evil came unto me:<br />
And when I waited for light, there came darkness.<br />
If I have withheld the poor from their desire,<br />
Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;<br />
Or have eaten my morsel myself alone,<br />
And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;<br />
If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,<br />
Or any poor without covering;<br />
If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,<br />
When I saw my help in the gate:<br />
Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade,<br />
And mine arm be broken from the bone.<br />
If I have made gold my hope,<br />
Or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;<br />
If I rejoiced because my wealth was great,<br />
And because mine hand had gotten much:<br />
This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge:<br />
For I should have denied the God that is above.<br />
If my land cry against me,<br />
Or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;<br />
If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,<br />
Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:<br />
Let thistles grow instead of wheat,<br />
And cockle instead of barley.<br />
</div>

<p>The words of Job are ended.</p>

<p>So these three men ceased to answer
Job, because he was righteous
in his own eyes. Then was kindled
the wrath of Elihu: against Job was
his wrath kindled, because he justified
himself rather than God. Also
against his three friends was his
wrath kindled, because they had
found no answer, and yet had condemned
Job.</p>

<p>And Elihu reasoned with Job, that
God gave no account of his ways to
men, but called them to repentance.
And Elihu said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing,<br />
And I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,<br />
I am clean without transgression, I am innocent;<br />
Neither is there iniquity in me.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>He counteth me for his enemy,<br />
He putteth my feet in the stocks,<br />
He marketh all my paths.<br />
Behold, in this thou art not just:<br />
I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.<br />
Why dost thou strive against him?<br />
For he giveth not account of any of his matters.<br />
For God speaketh once,<br />
Yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.<br />
He keepeth back his soul from the pit,<br />
And his life from perishing by the sword.<br />
Then he is gracious unto him, and saith,<br />
Deliver him from going down to the pit:<br />
I have found a ransom.<br />
He looketh upon men, and if any say,<br />
I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,<br />
And it profited me not;<br />
He will deliver his soul from going into the pit,<br />
And his life shall see the light.<br />
Lo, all these things worketh God<br />
Oftentimes with man,<br />
To bring back his soul from the pit,<br />
To be enlightened with the light of the living.<br /></div>
<div class="sidenote">Job 34</div>

<div class='poem'>
For his eyes are upon the ways of man,<br />
And he seeth all his goings.<br />
There is no darkness, nor shadow of death,<br />
Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.<br />
When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?<br />
And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?<br />
Whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:<br />
Surely it is meet to be said unto God,<br />
I have borne chastisement,<br />
I will not offend any more:<br />
That which I see not teach thou me:<br />
If I have done iniquity, I will do no more.<br />
Job hath spoken without knowledge,<br />
And his words were without wisdom.<br />
My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end<br />
Because of his answers for wicked men.<br />
For he addeth rebellion unto his sin,<br />
He clappeth his hands among us,<br />
And multiplieth his words against God.<br />
</div>

<p>Elihu also proceeded, and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee<br />
That I have yet to speak on God's behalf.<br />
I will fetch my knowledge from afar,<br />
And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.<br />
For truly my words shall not be false:<br />
He that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.<br />
Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any:<br />
He is mighty in strength and wisdom.<br />
He preserveth not the life of the wicked:<br />
But giveth right to the poor.<br />
He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:<br />
But with kings are they on the throne;<br />
Yea, he doth establish them for ever,<br />
and they are exalted.<br />
And if they be bound in fetters,<br />
And be holden in cords of affliction;<br />
Then he sheweth them their work,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>And their transgressions that they have exceeded.<br />
He openeth also their ear to discipline,<br />
And commandeth that they return from iniquity.<br />
If they obey and serve him,<br />
They shall spend their days in prosperity,<br />
And their years in pleasures.<br />
But if they obey not,<br />
They shall perish by the sword,<br />
And they shall die without knowledge.<br />
He delivereth the poor in his affliction,<br />
And openeth their ears in oppression.<br />
Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait<br />
Into a broad place, where there is no straitness;<br />
And that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.<br />
But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked:<br />
Judgment and justice take hold on thee.<br />
Behold, God is great, and we know him not,<br />
Neither can the number of his years be searched out.<br />
For he maketh small the drops of water:<br />
They pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:<br />
Which the clouds do drop<br />
And distil upon man abundantly.<br />
Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,<br />
Or the noise of his tabernacle?<br />
Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it,<br />
And covereth the bottom of the sea.<br />
With clouds he covereth the light;<br />
And commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.<br />
God thundereth marvellously with his voice;<br />
Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.<br />
For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth;<br />
Likewise to the small rain,<br />
And to the great rain of his strength.<br />
Out of the south cometh the whirlwind:<br />
And cold out of the north.<br />
By the breath of God frost is given:<br />
And the breadth of the waters is straitened.<br />
Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power,<br />
And in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.<br />
Men do therefore fear him:<br />
He respecteth not any that are wise of heart.<br />

<small>THE LORD REASONETH WITH JOB</small></h2>




<div class='drop-cap'>THEN the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> answered Job
out of the whirlwind, and
said,</div>
<div class="sidenote">Job 38</div>

<div class='poem'>
Who is this that darkeneth counsel<br />
By words without knowledge?<br />
Gird up now thy loins like a man;<br />
For I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.<br />
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?<br />
Declare, if thou hast understanding.<br />
Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest?<br />
Or who hath stretched the line upon it?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?<br />
Or who laid the corner stone thereof;<br />
When the morning stars sang together,<br />
And all the sons of God shouted for joy?<br />
Or who shut up the sea with doors?<br />
When I made the cloud the garment thereof,<br />
And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,<br />
And set bars and doors,<br />
And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further:<br />
And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?<br />
Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;<br />
And caused the dayspring to know his place;<br />
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,<br />
That the wicked might be shaken out of it?<br />
It is turned as clay to the seal;<br />
And they stand as a garment.<br />
And from the wicked their light is withholden,<br />
And the high arm shall be broken.<br />
Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?<br />
Or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?<br />
Have the gates of death been opened unto thee?<br />
Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?<br />
Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth?<br />
Declare if thou knowest it all.<br />
Where is the way where light dwelleth?<br />
And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,<br />
That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,<br />
And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?<br />
Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born?<br />
Or because the number of thy days is great?<br />
Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?<br />
Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,<br />
Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,<br />
Against the day of battle and war?<br />
By what way is the light parted,<br />
Which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?<br />
Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,<br />
Or a way for the lightning of thunder;<br />
To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is;<br />
On the wilderness wherein there is no man;<br />
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground;<br />
And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?<br />
Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go,<br />
And say unto thee, Here we are?<br />
Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?<br />
Or who hath given understanding to the heart?<br />
Who can number the clouds in wisdom?<br />
Or who can stay the bottles of heaven,<br />
When the dust groweth into hardness,<br />
And the clods cleave fast together?<br />
Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?<br />
Or fill the appetite of the young lions,<br />
When they couch in their dens,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>And abide in the covert to lie in wait?<br />
Who provideth for the raven his food?<br />
When his young ones cry unto God,<br />
They wander for lack of meat.<br /></div>
<div class="sidenote">Job 39</div>
<div class='poem'>
Who hath sent out the wild ass free?<br />
Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?<br />
Whose house I have made the wilderness,<br />
And the barren land his dwellings.<br />
He scorneth the multitude of the city,<br />
Neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.<br />
The range of the mountains is his pasture,<br />
And he searcheth after every green thing.<br />
Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee,<br />
Or abide by thy crib?<br />
Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow?<br />
Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?<br />
Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?<br />
Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?<br />
Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed,<br />
And gather it into thy barn?<br />
Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?<br />
Or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?<br />
Which leaveth her eggs in the earth,<br />
And warmeth them in dust,<br />
And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,<br />
Or that the wild beast may break them.<br />
She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's:<br />
Her labour is in vain without fear;<br />
Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,<br />
Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.<br />
What time she lifteth up herself on high,<br />
She scorneth the horse and his rider.<br />
Hast thou given the horse strength?<br />
Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?<br />
Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper?<br />
The glory of his nostrils is terrible.<br />
He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength:<br />
He goeth on to meet the armed men.<br />
He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted;<br />
Neither turneth he back from the sword.<br />
The quiver rattleth against him,<br />
The glittering spear and the shield.<br />
He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage:<br />
Neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.<br />
He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha;<br />
And he smelleth the battle afar off,<br />
The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.<br />
Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom,<br />
And stretch her wings toward the south?<br />
Doth the eagle mount up at thy command,<br />
And make her nest on high?<br />
She dwelleth and abideth on the rock,<br />
Upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.<br />
From thence she seeketh the prey,<br />
And her eyes behold afar off.<br />
Her young ones also suck up blood:<br />
And where the slain are, there is she.<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Job 40</div>

<p>Moreover the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> answered Job,
and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him?<br />
He that reproveth God, let him answer it.<br />
</div>

<p>Then Job answered the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee?<br />
I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.<br />
Once have I spoken; but I will not answer:<br />
Yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.<br />
</div>

<p>Then answered the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> unto Job
out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Gird up thy loins now like a man:<br />
I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.<br />
Wilt thou also disannul my judgment?<br />
Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?<br />
Hast thou an arm like God?<br />
Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?<br />
Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency;<br />
And array thyself with glory and beauty.<br />
Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath:<br />
And behold every one that is proud, and abase him.<br />
Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low;<br />
And tread down the wicked in their place.<br />
Hide them in the dust together;<br />
And bind their faces in secret.<br />
Then will I also confess unto thee<br />
That thine own right hand can save thee.<br />
Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee;<br />
He eateth grass as an ox.<br />
His bones are as strong pieces of brass;<br />
His bones are like bars of iron.<br />
He is the chief of the ways of God:<br />
He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.<br />
He lieth under the shady trees,<br />
In the covert of the reed, and fens.<br />
The shady trees cover him with their shadow;<br />
The willows of the brook compass him about.<br />
Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not:<br />
He trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.<br />
Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?<br />
Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?<br />
Canst thou put an hook into his nose?<br />
Or bore his jaw through with a thorn?<br />
Will he make many supplications unto thee?<br />
Will he speak soft words unto thee?<br />
Will he make a covenant with thee?<br />
Wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?<br />
Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?<br />
Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?<br />
Shall the companions make a banquet of him?<br />
Shall they part him among the merchants?<br />
Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?<br />
Or his head with fish spears?<br />
Lay thine hand upon him,<br />
Remember the battle, do no more.<br />
Behold, the hope of him is in vain:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?<br />
None is so fierce that dare stir him up:<br />
Who then is able to stand before me?<br />
Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him?<br />
Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.<br />
</div>

<p>Then Job answered the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
I know that thou canst do every thing,<br />
And that no thought can be withholden from thee.<br />
I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear:<br />
But now mine eye seeth thee.<br />
Wherefore I abhor myself,<br />
And repent in dust and ashes.<br />
</div>

<p>And it was so, that after the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
had spoken these words unto Job, the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> said to Eliphaz, My wrath is
kindled against thee, and against thy
two friends: for ye have not spoken
of me the thing that is right, as my
servant Job hath. Therefore take
unto you now seven bullocks and
seven rams, and go to my servant
Job, and offer up for yourselves a
burnt offering; and my servant Job
shall pray for you: for him will I
accept: lest I deal with you after
your folly, in that ye have not spoken
of me the thing which is right, like
my servant Job.</p>

<p>So Eliphaz and Bildad and Zophar
went, and did according as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
commanded them: the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> also accepted
Job. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> turned
the captivity of Job, when he prayed
for his friends: also the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> gave
Job twice as much as he had before.
Then came there unto him all his
brethren, and all his sisters, and all
they that had been of his acquaintance
before, and did eat bread with him
in his house: and they bemoaned him,
and comforted him over all the evil
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had brought upon him:
every man also gave him a piece of
money, and every one an earring of
gold.</p>

<p>So the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> blessed the latter end
of Job more than his beginning: for
he had fourteen thousand sheep, and
six thousand camels, and a thousand
yoke of oxen, and a thousand she
asses. He had also seven sons and
three daughters. And he called the
name of the first, Jemima; and the
name of the second, Kezia; and the
name of the third, Keren-happuch.
And in all the land were no women
found so fair as the daughters of Job:
and their father gave them inheritance
among their brethren.</p>

<p>After this lived Job an hundred
and forty years, and saw his sons, and
his sons' sons, even four generations.
So Job died, being old and full of
days.</p>

He beholdeth all the sons of men.<br />
From the place of his habitation he looketh<br />
Upon all the inhabitants of the earth.<br />
He fashioneth their hearts alike;<br />
He considereth all their works.<br />
There is no king saved by the multitude of an host:<br />
A mighty man is not delivered by much strength.<br />
An horse is a vain thing for safety:<br />
Neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.<br />
Behold, the eye of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is upon them that fear him,<br />
Upon them that hope in his mercy;<br />
To deliver their soul from death,<br />

Our soul waiteth for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>:<br />
He is our help and our shield.<br />
For our heart shall rejoice in him,<br />
Because we have trusted in his holy name.<br />
Let thy mercy, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, be upon us,<br />

Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:<br />
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters:<br />
Who maketh the clouds his chariot:<br />
Who walketh upon the wings of the wind:<br />
Who maketh his angels spirits;<br />
His ministers a flaming fire:<br />
Who laid the foundations of the earth,<br />
That it should not be removed for ever.<br />
Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment:<br />
The waters stood above the mountains.<br />
At thy rebuke they fled;<br />
At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.<br />
They go up by the mountains;<br />
They go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.<br />
Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over;<br />
That they turn not again to cover the earth.<br />
He sendeth the springs into the valleys,<br />
Which run among the hills.<br />
They give drink to every beast of the field:<br />
The wild asses quench their thirst.<br />
By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,<br />
Which sing among the branches.<br />
He watereth the hills from his chambers:<br />
The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.<br />
He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,<br />
And herb for the service of man:<br />
That he may bring forth food out of the earth;<br />
And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,<br />
And oil to make his face to shine,<br />
And bread which strengtheneth man's heart.<br />
The trees of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> are full of sap;<br />
The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;<br />
Where the birds make their nests:<br />
As for the stork, the fir trees are her house.<br />
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats;<br />
And the rocks for the conies.<br />
He appointed the moon for seasons:<br />
The sun knoweth his going down.<br />
Thou makest darkness, and it is night:<br />
Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.<br />
The young lions roar after their prey,<br />
And seek their meat from God.<br />
The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together,<br />
And lay them down in their dens.<br />
Man goeth forth unto his work<br />
And to his labour until the evening.<br />
O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, how manifold are thy works!<br />
In wisdom hast thou made them all:<br />
The earth is full of thy riches.<br />
So is this great and wide sea,<br />
Wherein are things creeping innumerable,<br />
Both small and great beasts.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>There go the ships:<br />
There is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.<br />
These wait all upon thee;<br />

That thou givest them they gather:<br />
Thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.<br />
Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled:<br />
Thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.<br />
Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created:<br />
And thou renewest the face of the earth.<br />
The glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall endure for ever:<br />
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall rejoice in his works.<br />
He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth:<br />
He toucheth the hills, and they smoke.<br />

I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.<br />
My meditation of him shall be sweet:<br />

Again, they are minished and brought low<br />
Through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.<br />
He poureth contempt upon princes,<br />
And causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.<br />
Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction,<br />
And maketh him families like a flock.<br />
The righteous shall see it, and rejoice:<br />

<span class="smcap">O Lord</span>, thou hast searched me, and known me.<br />
Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising,<br />
Thou understandest my thought afar off.<br />
Thou compassest my path and my lying down,<br />
And art acquainted with all my ways.<br />
For there is not a word in my tongue,<br />
But, lo, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, thou knowest it altogether.<br />
Thou hast beset me behind and before,<br />
And laid thine hand upon me.<br />
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;<br />
It is high, I cannot attain unto it.<br />
Whither shall I go from thy spirit?<br />
Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?<br />
If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:<br />
If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.<br />
If I take the wings of the morning,<br />
And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;<br />
Even there shall thy hand lead me,<br />
And thy right hand shall hold me.<br />
If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me;<br />
Even the night shall be light about me.<br />
Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee;<br />
But the night shineth as the day:<br />
The darkness and the light are both alike to thee....<br />
I will praise thee;<br />
For I am fearfully and wonderfully made:<br />
Marvellous are thy works;<br />
And that my soul knoweth right well....<br />
Search me, O God, and know my heart:<br />
Try me, and know my thoughts:<br />
And see if there be any wicked way in me,<br />
And lead me in the way everlasting.<br />

<div class='drop-cap'>THE proverbs of Solomon the
son of David, king of Israel.</div>
<div class='poem'>
The fear of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is the beginning of knowledge:<br />
But fools despise wisdom and instruction.<br />
My son, hear the instruction of thy father,<br />
And forsake not the law of thy mother:<br />
For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head,<br />
And chains about thy neck.<br />
My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.<br />
Let not mercy and truth forsake thee:<br />
Bind them about thy neck;<br />
Write them upon the table of thine heart:<br />
So shalt thou find favour and good understanding<br />
In the sight of God and man.<br />
Trust in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> with all thine heart;<br />
And lean not unto thine own understanding.<br />
In all thy ways acknowledge him,<br />
And he shall direct thy paths.<br />
Be not wise in thine own eyes:<br />
Fear the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and depart from evil.<br />
My son, despise not the chastening of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>;<br />
Neither be weary of his correction:<br />
For whom the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> loveth he correcteth;<br />
Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.<br />
Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,<br />
And the man that getteth understanding.<br />
For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver,<br />
And the gain thereof than fine gold.<br />
She is more precious than rubies:<br />
And all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.<br />
Length of days is in her right hand;<br />
And in her left hand riches and honour.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>Her ways are ways of pleasantness,<br />
And all her paths are peace.<br /></div>
<div class="sidenote">Proverbs 4</div><div class='poem'>
Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom:<br />
And with all thy getting get understanding.<br />
Exalt her, and she shall promote thee:<br />
She shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.<br />
She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace:<br />
A crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.<br />
The path of the just is as the shining light,<br />
That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.<br />
The way of the wicked is as darkness:<br />
They know not at what they stumble.<br />
Keep thy heart with all diligence;<br />
For out of it are the issues of life.<br />
Go to the ant, thou sluggard;<br />
Consider her ways, and be wise:<br />
Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,<br />
Provideth her meat in the summer,<br />
And gathereth her food in the harvest.<br />
How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?<br />
When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?<br />
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,<br />
A little folding of the hands to sleep:<br />
So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth,<br />
And thy want as an armed man.<br />
These six things doth the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hate:<br />
Yea, seven are an abomination unto him:<br />
A proud look, a lying tongue,<br />
And hands that shed innocent blood,<br />
An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations,<br />
Feet that be swift in running to mischief,<br />
A false witness that speaketh lies,<br />
And he that soweth discord among brethren.<br />
Doth not wisdom cry?<br />
And understanding put forth her voice?<br />
She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city,<br />
At the coming in at the doors.<br />
Unto you, O men, I call;<br />
And my voice is to the sons of man.<br />
Wisdom is better than rubies;<br />
And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.<br />
I love them that love me;<br />
And those that seek me early shall find me.<br />
Riches and honour are with me;<br />
Yea, durable riches and righteousness.<br />
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> possessed me in the beginning of his way,<br />
Before his works of old.<br />
I was set up from everlasting,<br />
From the beginning, or ever the earth was.<br />
When there were no depths, I was brought forth;<br />
When there were no fountains abounding with water.<br />
Before the mountains were settled,<br />
Before the hills was I brought forth:<br />
While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,<br />
Nor the highest part of the dust of the world.<br />
When he prepared the heavens, I was there:<br />
When he set a compass upon the face of the depth:<br />
When he established the clouds above:<br />
When he strengthened the fountains of the deep:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>When he gave to the sea his decree,<br />
That the waters should not pass his commandment:<br />
When he appointed the foundations of the earth:<br />
Then I was by him, as one brought up with him:<br />
And I was daily his delight,<br />
Rejoicing always before him;<br />
Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth;<br />
And my delights were with the sons of men.<br />
Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children:<br />
For blessed are they that keep my ways.<br />
Hear instruction, and be wise,<br />
And refuse it not.<br />
Blessed is the man that heareth me,<br />
Watching daily at my gates,<br />
Waiting at the posts of my doors.<br />
For whoso findeth me findeth life,<br />
And shall obtain favour of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.<br />
But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul:<br />
All they that hate me love death.<br /></div>

<div class="sidenote">Proverbs 9</div>
<div class='poem'>
The fear of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is the beginning of wisdom:<br />
And the knowledge of the holy is understanding.<br />
A wise son maketh a glad father:<br />
But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.<br />
He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand:<br />
But the hand of the diligent maketh rich.<br />
Hatred stirreth up strifes:<br />
But love covereth all sins.<br />
He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction:<br />
But he that refuseth reproof erreth.<br />
He that hideth hatred with lying lips,<br />
And he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.<br />
In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin:<br />
But he that refraineth his lips is wise.<br />
The blessing of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, it maketh rich,<br />
And he addeth no sorrow with it.<br />
When pride cometh, then cometh shame:<br />
But with the lowly is wisdom.<br />
A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast:<br />
But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.<br />
The way of a fool is right in his own eyes:<br />
But he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.<br />
The lip of truth shall be established for ever:<br />
But a lying tongue is but for a moment.<br />
Lying lips are abomination to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>:<br />
But they that deal truly are his delight.<br />
He that walketh with wise men shall be wise:<br />
But a companion of fools shall be destroyed.<br />
He that spareth his rod hateth his son:<br />
But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.<br />
He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth:<br />
But he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he.<br />
A soft answer turneth away wrath:<br />
But grievous words stir up anger.<br />
The eyes of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> are in every place,<br />
Beholding the evil and the good.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>A fool despiseth his father's instruction:<br />

Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,<br />
Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.<br /></div>

<div class="sidenote">Proverbs 16</div><div class='poem'>
Pride goeth before destruction,<br />
And an haughty spirit before a fall.<br />
Pleasant words are as an honeycomb,<br />
Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.<br />
The hoary head is a crown of glory,<br />
If it be found in the way of righteousness.<br />
He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty;<br />
And he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.<br />
Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker:<br />
And he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.<br />
Whoso rewardeth evil for good,<br />
Evil shall not depart from his house.<br />
The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:<br />
Therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.<br />
A friend loveth at all times,<br />
And a brother is born for adversity.<br />
A merry heart doeth good like a medicine:<br />
But a broken spirit drieth the bones.<br />
He also that is slothful in his work<br />
Is brother to him that is a great waster.<br />
Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep;<br />
And an idle soul shall suffer hunger.<br />
Even a child is known by his doings,<br />
Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.<br />
Whoso curseth his father or his mother,<br />
His lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.<br />
To do justice and judgment<br />
Is more acceptable to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> than sacrifice.<br />
Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor,<br />
He also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.<br />
He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man:<br />
He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.<br />
Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue<br />
Keepeth his soul from troubles.<br />
A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches,<br />
And loving favour rather than silver and gold.<br />
The rich and poor meet together:<br />
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is the maker of them all.<br />
Train up a child in the way he should go:<br />
And when he is old, he will not depart from it.<br />
He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed;<br />
For he giveth of his bread to the poor.<br />
Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child;<br />
But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.<br />
Rob not the poor, because he is poor:<br />
Neither oppress the afflicted in the gate.<br />
Hearken unto thy father that begat thee,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>And despise not thy mother when she is old.<br />
Look not thou upon the wine when it is red,<br />
When it giveth his colour in the cup,<br />
When it moveth itself aright.<br />
At the last it biteth like a serpent,<br />
And stingeth like an adder.<br /></div><div class="sidenote">Proverbs 24</div>

Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,<br />
And let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth.<br />
If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat;<br />
And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:<br />
For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,<br />
And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall reward thee.<br />
Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?<br />
There is more hope of a fool than of him.<br />
Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein:<br />

Boast not thyself of to morrow;<br />
For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.<br />
Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth;<br />
A stranger, and not thine own lips.<br />
Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not.<br />
A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself;<br />
But the simple pass on, and are punished.<br />
Iron sharpeneth iron;<br />
So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.<br />
Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof:<br />
So he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.<br />
As in water face answereth to face,<br />
So the heart of man to man.<br />
The wicked flee when no man pursueth:<br />
But the righteous are bold as a lion.<br />
Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness,<br />
Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.<br />
Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son:<br />
But he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.<br />
He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law,<br />
Even his prayer shall be abomination.<br />
Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way,<br />
He shall fall himself into his own pit:<br />
But the upright shall have good things in possession.<br />
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper:<br />
But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.<br />
Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved:<br />
But he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.<br />
He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread:<br />
But he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.<br />
He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour<br />
Than he that flattereth with the tongue.<br />
Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression;<br />
The same is the companion of a destroyer.<br />
He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife:<br />
But he that putteth his trust in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall be made fat.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool:<br />

He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack:<br />
But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.<br />
He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck,<br />
Shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.<br />
When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice:<br />
But when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.<br />
A man that flattereth his neighbour<br />
Spreadeth a net for his feet.<br />
The righteous considereth the cause of the poor:<br />
But the wicked regardeth not to know it.<br />
If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man,<br />
Whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.<br />
A fool uttereth all his mind:<br />
But a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.<br />
Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words?<br />
There is more hope of a fool than of him.<br />
An angry man stirreth up strife,<br />
And a furious man aboundeth in transgression.<br />
A man's pride shall bring him low:<br />
But honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.<br />
Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul:<br />
He heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.<br />
The fear of man bringeth a snare:<br />
But whoso putteth his trust in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall be safe.<br />

And the strong men shall bow themselves,<br />
And the grinders cease because they are few,<br />
And those that look out of the windows be darkened,<br />
And the doors shall be shut in the streets,<br />
When the sound of the grinding is low,<br />
And he shall rise up at the voice of the bird,<br />
And all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;<br />
Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high,<br />
And fears shall be in the way,<br />
And the almond tree shall flourish,<br />
And the grasshopper shall be a burden,<br />
And desire shall fail:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>Because man goeth to his long home,<br />
and the mourners go about the streets:<br />
Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken,<br />
Or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.<br />
Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was:<br />
And the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.<br />
</div></div>

<p>Let us hear the conclusion of the
whole matter: Fear God, and keep
his commandments: for this is the
whole duty of man. For God shall
bring every work into judgment, with
every secret thing, whether it be
good, or whether it be evil.</p>

<h2>BOOK XIII&mdash;THE PROPHETS</h2>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_139" id="CHAPTER_139">CHAPTER 139</a><br />

<small>PROPHECIES OF ISAIAH</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="150" height="176" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THE vision of Isaiah
the son of Amoz,
which he saw concerning
Judah and
Jerusalem in the
days of Uzziah,
Jotham, Ahaz, and
Hezekiah, kings of
Judah. Hear, O
heavens, and give ear, O earth: for
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath spoken, I have nourished
and brought up children, and
they have rebelled against me. The
ox knoweth his owner, and the ass
his master's crib: but Israel doth
not know, my people doth not consider.
Come now, and let us reason
together, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: though
your sins be as scarlet, they shall
be as white as snow; though they
be red like crimson, they shall be as
wool.</div>

<p>And it shall come to pass in the last
days, that the mountain of the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>
house shall be established in the top
of the mountains, and shall be exalted
above the hills; and all nations shall
flow unto it. And many people shall
go and say, Come ye, and let us go up
to the mountain of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to the
house of the God of Jacob; and he will
teach us of his ways, and we will walk
in his paths: for out of Zion shall go
forth the law, and the word of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> from Jerusalem. And he shall
judge among the nations, and shall
rebuke many people: and they shall
beat their swords into plowshares,
and their spears into pruninghooks:
nation shall not lift up sword against
nation, neither shall they learn war
any more. O house of Jacob, come
ye, and let us walk in the light of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>Therefore the Lord himself shall
give you a sign; Behold, a virgin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
shall conceive, and bear a son, and
shall call his name Immanuel. Butter
and honey shall he eat, that he
may know to refuse the evil, and
choose the good. For before the child
shall know to refuse the evil, and
choose the good, the land that thou
abhorrest shall be forsaken of both
her kings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Isaiah 9</div>

<p>The people that walked in darkness
have seen a great light: they that
dwell in the land of the shadow of
death, upon them hath the light
shined. Unto us a child is born, unto
us a son is given: and the government
shall be upon his shoulder: and
his name shall be called Wonderful,
Counsellor, The mighty God, The
everlasting Father, The Prince of
Peace. Of the increase of his government
and peace there shall be no
end, upon the throne of David, and
upon his kingdom, to order it, and to
establish it with judgment and with
justice from henceforth even for ever.
The zeal of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts will perform
this.</p>

<p>And there shall come forth a rod
out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch
shall grow out of his roots: and the
spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall rest upon
him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
the spirit of counsel and
might, the spirit of knowledge and of
the fear of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and shall make
him of quick understanding in the fear
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and he shall not judge
after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove
after the hearing of his ears: but
with righteousness shall he judge the
poor, and reprove with equity for the
meek of the earth: and he shall smite
the earth with the rod of his mouth,
and with the breath of his lips shall
he slay the wicked. And righteousness
shall be the girdle of his loins,
and faithfulness the girdle of his
reins. The wolf also shall dwell with
the lamb, and the leopard shall lie
down with the kid; and the calf and
the young lion and the fatling together;
and a little child shall lead
them. And the cow and the bear shall
feed; their young ones shall lie down
together: and the lion shall eat straw
like the ox. And the sucking child
shall play on the hole of the asp, and
the weaned child shall put his hand
on the cockatrice' den. They shall
not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
mountain: for the earth shall be full
of the knowledge of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, as the
waters cover the sea.</p>

<p>And in that day there shall be a
root of Jesse, which shall stand for
an ensign of the people; to it shall the
Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be
glorious. Behold, God is my salvation;
I will trust, and not be afraid:
for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> JEHOVAH is my
strength and my song; he also is become
my salvation. Therefore with
joy shall ye draw water out of the
wells of salvation. And in that day
shall ye say, Praise the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, call
upon his name, declare his doings
among the people, make mention that
his name is exalted. Sing unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>; for he hath done excellent
things: this is known in all the earth.
Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of
Zion: for great is the Holy One of
Israel in the midst of thee. He will
swallow up death in victory; and the
Lord <span class="smcap">God</span> will wipe away tears from
off all faces; and the rebuke of his
people shall he take away from off
all the earth: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath
spoken it. And it shall be said in that
day, Lo, this is our God; we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
waited for him, and he will save us:
this is the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; we have waited for
him, we will be glad and rejoice in
his salvation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Isaiah 26</div>

<p>In that day shall this song be sung
in the land of Judah; We have a
strong city; salvation will God appoint
for walls and bulwarks. Open
ye the gates, that the righteous nation
which keepeth the truth may enter in.
Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace,
whose mind is stayed on thee: because
he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> for ever: for in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> JEHOVAH
is everlasting strength: for
he bringeth down them that dwell
on high; the lofty city, he layeth
it low; he layeth it low, even to
the ground; he bringeth it even to
the dust. The foot shall tread it
down, even the feet of the poor, and
the steps of the needy. The way of
the just is uprightness: thou, most
upright, dost weigh the path of the
just. Yea, in the way of thy judgments,
O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, have we waited for
thee; the desire of our soul is to thy
name, and to the remembrance of
thee. With my soul have I desired
thee in the night; yea, with my spirit
within me will I seek thee early: for
when thy judgments are in the earth,
the inhabitants of the world will learn
righteousness.</p>

<p>Thus saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>, Behold,
I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone,
a tried stone, a precious corner stone,
a sure foundation: he that believeth
shall not make haste. Behold, a king
shall reign in righteousness, and
princes shall rule in judgment. And
a man shall be as an hiding place from
the wind, and a covert from the tempest;
as rivers of water in a dry place,
as the shadow of a great rock in a
weary land. And the eyes of them
that see shall not be dim, and the ears
of them that hear shall hearken. The
heart also of the rash shall understand
knowledge, and the tongue of
the stammerers shall be ready to
speak plainly.</p>

<p>Hear, ye that are far off, what I
have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge
my might. The sinners
in Zion are afraid; fearfulness
hath surprised the hypocrites. Who
among us shall dwell with the devouring
fire? Who among us shall dwell
with everlasting burnings? He that
walketh righteously, and speaketh
uprightly; he that despiseth the gain
of oppressions, that shaketh his hands
from holding of bribes, that stoppeth
his ears from hearing of blood, and
shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; he
shall dwell on high: his place of defence
shall be the munitions of rocks:
bread shall be given him; his waters
shall be sure. Thine eyes shall see
the king in his beauty: they shall behold
the land that is very far off.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is our judge, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
is our lawgiver, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is our king;
he will save us.</p>

<p>The wilderness and the solitary
place shall be glad for them; and the
desert shall rejoice, and blossom as
the rose. Strengthen ye the weak
hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
Say to them that are of a fearful
heart, Be strong, fear not: behold,
your God will come with vengeance,
even God with a recompence; he will
come and save you.</p>

<p>Then the eyes of the blind shall be
opened, and the ears of the deaf shall
be unstopped. Then shall the lame
man leap as an hart, and the tongue
of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
shall waters break out, and
streams in the desert. And the
parched ground shall become a pool,
and the thirsty land springs of water.</p>

<p>And the ransomed of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall
return, and come to Zion with songs
and everlasting joy upon their heads:
they shall obtain joy and gladness,
and sorrow and sighing shall flee
away.</p>

<small>PROMISES OF THE MESSIAH AND
OF GOSPEL GRACE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Isaiah 40</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>COMFORT ye, comfort ye my
people, saith your God. Speak
ye comfortably to Jerusalem,
and cry unto her, that her warfare is
accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned:
for she hath received of the
<span class="smcap">Lord's</span> hand double for all her sins.</div>

<p>The voice of him that crieth in the
wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, make straight in the desert a
highway for our God. Every valley
shall be exalted, and every mountain
and hill shall be made low: and the
crooked shall be made straight, and
the rough places plain: and the glory
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall be revealed, and all
flesh shall see it together: for the
mouth of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath spoken it.
The voice said, Cry. And he said,
What shall I cry? All flesh is grass,
and all the goodliness thereof is as the
flower of the field: the grass withereth,
the flower fadeth: because the
spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> bloweth upon it:
surely the people is grass. The grass
withereth, the flower fadeth: but the
word of our God shall stand for ever.</p>

<p>O Zion, that bringest good tidings,
get thee up into the high mountain;
O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings,
lift up thy voice with strength;
lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the
cities of Judah, Behold your God!
Behold, the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span> will come with
strong hand, and his arm shall rule
for him: behold, his reward is with
him, and his work before him. He
shall feed his flock like a shepherd:
he shall gather the lambs with his
arm, and carry them in his bosom, and
shall gently lead those that are with
young.</p>

<p>Who hath measured the waters in
the hollow of his hand, and meted out
heaven with the span, and comprehended
the dust of the earth in a
measure, and weighed the mountains
in scales, and the hills in a balance?
Behold, the nations are as a drop of
a bucket, and are counted as the small
dust of the balance: behold, he taketh
up the isles as a very little thing.
All nations before him are as nothing;
and they are counted to him less than
nothing, and vanity.</p>

<p>To whom then will ye liken God?
or what likeness will ye compare
unto him? Have ye not known? have
ye not heard? hath it not been told
you from the beginning? have ye not
understood from the foundations of
the earth? It is he that sitteth upon
the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants
thereof are as grasshoppers;
that stretcheth out the heavens
as a curtain, and spreadeth them out
as a tent to dwell in: that bringeth
the princes to nothing; he maketh the
judges of the earth as vanity. To
whom then will ye liken me, or shall
I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift
up your eyes on high, and behold who
hath created these things, that bringeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
out their host by number: he calleth
them all by names by the greatness
of his might, for that he is strong
in power; not one faileth. Why sayest
thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O
Israel, My way is hid from the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and my judgment is passed over from
my God?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Isaiah 41</div>

<p>Hast thou not known? hast thou
not heard, that the everlasting God,
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the Creator of the ends of
the earth, fainteth not, neither is
weary? there is no searching of his
understanding. He giveth power to
the faint; and to them that have no
might he increaseth strength. Even
the youths shall faint and be weary,
and the young men shall utterly fall:
but they that wait upon the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall
renew their strength; they shall
mount up with wings as eagles; they
shall run, and not be weary; and they
shall walk, and not faint. When the
poor and needy seek water, and there
is none, and their tongue faileth for
thirst, I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will hear them, I
the God of Israel will not forsake
them. I will open rivers in high
places, and fountains in the midst of
the valleys: I will make the wilderness
a pool of water, and the dry land
springs of water. I will plant in
the wilderness the cedar, the shittah
tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree;
I will set in the desert the fir
tree, and the pine, and the box tree
together: that they may see, and
know, and consider, and understand
together, that the hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
hath done this, and the Holy One of
Israel hath created it.</p>

<p>Behold my servant, whom I uphold;
mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth;
I have put my spirit upon him:
he shall bring forth judgment to the
Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor lift
up, nor cause his voice to be heard
in the street. A bruised reed shall
he not break, and the smoking flax
shall he not quench: he shall bring
forth judgment unto truth. He shall
not fail nor be discouraged, till he
have set judgment in the earth: and
the isles shall wait for his law.</p>

<p>Thus saith God the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, he that
created the heavens, and stretched
them out; he that spread forth the
earth, and that which cometh out of
it; he that giveth breath unto the people
upon it, and spirit to them that
walk therein: I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> have called
thee in righteousness, and will hold
thine hand, and will keep thee, and
give thee for a covenant of the people,
for a light of the Gentiles; to open
the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners
from the prison, and them that
sit in darkness out of the prison
house. I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: that is my
name: and my glory will I not give
to another, neither my praise to graven
images. Behold, the former
things are come to pass, and new
things do I declare: before they
spring forth I tell you of them. Sing
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> a new song, and his
praise from the end of the earth, ye
that go down to the sea, and all that
is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants
thereof. Let the wilderness and
the cities thereof lift up their voice,
the villages that Kedar doth inhabit:
let the inhabitants of the rock sing,
let them shout from the top of the
mountains. Let them give glory unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and declare his praise in the
islands. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall go forth as
a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy
like a man of war: he shall cry,
yea, roar; he shall prevail against his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
enemies. I have long time holden my
peace; I have been still, and refrained
myself: now will I cry like
a travailing woman; I will destroy
and devour at once. I will make
waste mountains and hills, and dry
up all their herbs; and I will make
the rivers islands, and I will dry up
the pools. And I will bring the blind
by a way that they knew not; I will
lead them in paths that they have not
known: I will make darkness light
before them, and crooked things
straight. These things will I do unto
them, and not forsake them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Isaiah 43</div>

<p>But now thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that
created thee, O Jacob, and he that
formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for
I have redeemed thee, I have called
thee by thy name; thou art mine.
When thou passest through the waters,
I will be with thee; and through
the rivers, they shall not overflow
thee: when thou walkest through the
fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither
shall the flame kindle upon thee. For
I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, the Holy One
of Israel, thy Saviour. Since thou
wast precious in my sight, thou hast
been honourable, and I have loved
thee: therefore will I give men for
thee, and people for thy life. Fear
not: for I am with thee: I will bring
thy seed from the east, and gather
thee from the west; I will say to the
north, Give up; and to the south,
Keep not back: bring my sons from
far, and my daughters from the ends
of the earth; even every one that is
called by my name: for I have created
him for my glory, I have formed
him; yea, I have made him.</p>

<p>Bring forth the blind people that
have eyes, and the deaf that have
ears. Let all the nations be gathered
together, and let the people be assembled:
who among them can declare
this, and shew us former things? let
them bring forth their witnesses, that
they may be justified: or let them
hear, and say, It is truth. Ye are my
witnesses, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and my servant
whom I have chosen: that ye
may know and believe me, and understand
that I am he: before me there
was no God formed, neither shall
there be after me. I, even I, am the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and beside me there is no saviour.
I have declared, and have
saved, and I have shewed, when there
was no strange god among you:
therefore ye are my witnesses, saith
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that I am God. Yea, before
the day was I am he; and there is
none that can deliver out of my hand:
I will work, and who shall let it?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Isaiah 45</div>

<p>Remember these, O Jacob and Israel;
for thou art my servant: I have
formed thee; thou art my servant: O
Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of
me. I have blotted out, as a thick
cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a
cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for
I have redeemed thee. Sing, O ye
heavens; for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath done it:
shout, ye lower parts of the earth:
break forth into singing, ye mountains,
O forest, and every tree therein:
for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath redeemed Jacob,
and glorified himself in Israel.
Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, thy redeemer,
I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that maketh all things;
that stretcheth forth the heavens
alone; that spreadeth abroad the
earth by myself; that frustrateth the
tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners
mad; that turneth wise men backward,
and maketh their knowledge
foolish; that confirmeth the word of
his servant, and performeth the counsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
of his messengers; that saith to
Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited;
and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall
be built, and I will raise up the decayed
places thereof: that saith to the
deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy
rivers: that saith of Cyrus, He is my
shepherd, and shall perform all my
pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem,
Thou shalt be built; and to the temple,
Thy foundation shall be laid. I
have not spoken in secret, in a dark
place of the earth: I said not unto the
seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain:
I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> speak righteousness, I declare
things that are right. Assemble
yourselves and come; draw near together,
ye that are escaped of the
nations: they have no knowledge that
set up the wood of their graven image,
and pray unto a god that cannot
save. Tell ye, and bring them near;
yea, let them take counsel together:
who hath declared this from ancient
time? who hath told it from that
time? have not I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? and there
is no God else beside me; a just God
and a Saviour; there is none beside
me. Look unto me, and be ye saved,
all the ends of the earth: for I am
God, and there is none else. I have
sworn by myself, the word is gone
out of my mouth in righteousness,
and shall not return, That unto me
every knee shall bow, every tongue
shall swear. Surely, shall one say,
in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> have I righteousness and
strength: even to him shall men come;
and all that are incensed against him
shall be ashamed. In the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall
all the seed of Israel be justified, and
shall glory. Behold, I have refined
thee, but not with silver; I have
chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.
O that thou hadst hearkened
to my commandments! then had thy
peace been as a river, and thy righteousness
as the waves of the sea.
There is no peace, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
unto the wicked. Sing, O heavens;
and be joyful, O earth; and break
forth into singing, O mountains: for
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath comforted his people,
and will have mercy upon his afflicted.
But Zion said, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath forsaken
me, and my Lord hath forgotten
me. Can a woman forget her
sucking child, that she should not
have compassion on her son? yea,
they may forget, yet will I not forget
thee. Behold, I have graven thee
upon the palms of my hands; thy
walls are continually before me. For
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall comfort Zion: he will
comfort all her waste places; and he
will make her wilderness like Eden,
and her desert like the garden of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>; joy and gladness shall be found
therein, thanksgiving, and the voice
of melody.</p>

<p>Hearken unto me, my people; and
give ear unto me, O my nation: for a
law shall proceed from me, and I will
make my judgment to rest for a light
of the people. My righteousness is
near; my salvation is gone forth, and
mine arms shall judge the people; the
isles shall wait upon me, and on mine
arm shall they trust. Lift up your
eyes to the heavens, and look upon
the earth beneath: for the heavens
shall vanish away like smoke, and the
earth shall wax old like a garment,
and they that dwell therein shall die
in like manner: but my salvation shall
be for ever, and my righteousness
shall not be abolished.</p>

<p>Hearken unto me, ye that know
righteousness, the people in whose
heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
of men, neither be ye afraid
of their revilings. For the moth shall
eat them up like a garment, and the
worm shall eat them like wool: but
my righteousness shall be for ever,
and my salvation from generation to
generation.</p>

<p>Awake, awake, put on strength, O
arm of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; awake, as in the ancient
days, in the generations of old.
Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab,
and wounded the dragon? Art thou
not it which hath dried the sea, the
waters of the great deep; that hath
made the depths of the sea a way for
the ransomed to pass over? Therefore
the redeemed of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall
return, and come with singing unto
Zion; and everlasting joy shall be
upon their head: they shall obtain
gladness and joy; and sorrow and
mourning shall flee away. I, even I,
am he that comforteth you: who art
thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of
a man that shall die, and of the son
of man which shall be made as grass;
and forgettest the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy maker,
that hath stretched forth the heavens,
and laid the foundations of the earth?</p>

<small>GOOD TIDINGS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Isaiah 52</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>HOW beautiful upon the mountains

bringeth good tidings, that
publisheth peace; that bringeth good
tidings of good, that publisheth salvation;
that saith unto Zion, Thy God

for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath comforted his

Behold, my servant shall deal prudently,
he shall be exalted and extolled,

were astonied at thee; his visage
was so marred more than any man,
and his form more than the sons of
men: so shall he sprinkle many nations;
the kings shall shut their
mouths at him: for that which had
not been told them shall they see; and
that which they had not heard shall
they consider.</div>

<p>Who hath believed our report? and
to whom is the arm of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> revealed?
For he shall grow up before
him as a tender plant, and as a root
out of a dry ground: he hath no form
nor comeliness; and when we shall see
him, there is no beauty that we should
desire him. He is despised and rejected
of men; a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with grief: and we hid as
it were our faces from him; he was
despised, and we esteemed him not.
Surely he hath borne our griefs, and
carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem
him stricken, smitten of God,
and afflicted. But he was wounded
for our transgressions, he was bruised
for our iniquities: the chastisement
of our peace was upon him; and with
his stripes we are healed. All we like
sheep have gone astray; we have
turned every one to his own way; and
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath laid on him the iniquity
of us all. He was oppressed, and he
was afflicted, yet he opened not his
mouth: he is brought as a lamb to
the slaughter, and as a sheep before
her shearers is dumb, so he openeth
not his mouth. He was taken from
prison and from judgment: and who
shall declare his generation? for he
was cut off out of the land of the living:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
for the transgression of my people
was he stricken. And he made his
grave with the wicked, and with the
rich in his death; because he had done
no violence, neither was any deceit in
his mouth. Yet it pleased the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
to bruise him; he hath put him to
grief: when thou shalt make his soul
an offering for sin, he shall see his
seed, he shall prolong his days, and
the pleasure of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall prosper
in his hand. He shall see of the travail
of his soul, and shall be satisfied:
by his knowledge shall my righteous
servant justify many; for he shall
bear their iniquities. Therefore will
I divide him a portion with the great,
and he shall divide the spoil with the
strong; because he hath poured out
his soul unto death: and he was numbered
with the transgressors; and he
bare the sin of many, and made intercession
for the transgressors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Isaiah 55</div>

<p>Ho, every one that thirsteth, come
ye to the waters, and he that hath no
money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea,
come, buy wine and milk without
money and without price. Wherefore
do ye spend money for that which is
not bread? and your labour for that
which satisfieth not? hearken diligently
unto me, and eat ye that which
is good, and let your soul delight itself
in fatness. Incline your ear, and
come unto me: hear, and your soul
shall live; and I will make an everlasting
covenant with you, even the
sure mercies of David.</p>

<p>Seek ye the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> while he may be
found, call ye upon him while he is
near: let the wicked forsake his
way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts: and let him return unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and he will have mercy upon
him; and to our God, for he will abundantly
pardon. For my thoughts are
not your thoughts, neither are your
ways my ways, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. For
as the heavens are higher than the
earth, so are my ways higher than
your ways, and my thoughts than
your thoughts. For as the rain cometh
down, and the snow from heaven,
and returneth not thither, but watereth
the earth, and maketh it bring
forth and bud, that it may give seed
to the sower, and bread to the eater:
so shall my word be that goeth forth
out of my mouth: it shall not return
unto me void, but it shall accomplish
that which I please, and it shall prosper
in the thing whereto I sent it.
For ye shall go out with joy, and be
led forth with peace: the mountains
and the hills shall break forth before
you into singing, and all the trees of
the field shall clap their hands. Instead
of the thorn shall come up the
fir tree, and instead of the brier shall
come up the myrtle tree: and it shall
be to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> for a name, for an
everlasting sign that shall not be cut
off.</p>

<p>Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Keep ye judgment,
and do justice: for my salvation
is near to come, and my righteousness
to be revealed. Blessed is
the man that doeth this, and the son of
man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth
the sabbath from polluting it, and
keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
Even unto them will I give in mine
house and within my walls a place
and a name better than of sons and of
daughters: I will give them an everlasting
name, that shall not be cut off.
Also the sons of the stranger, that
join themselves to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to serve
him, and to love the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
to be his servants, every one that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
keepeth the sabbath from polluting
it, and taketh hold of my covenant;
even them will I bring to my holy
mountain, and make them joyful in
my house of prayer: their burnt offerings
and their sacrifices shall be
accepted upon mine altar; for mine
house shall be called an house of
prayer for all people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Isaiah 57</div>

<p>For thus saith the high and lofty
One that inhabiteth eternity, whose
name is Holy; I dwell in the high and
holy place, with him also that is of a
contrite and humble spirit, to revive
the spirit of the humble, and to revive
the heart of the contrite ones. For I
will not contend for ever, neither will
I be always wroth: for the spirit
should fail before me, and the souls
which I have made. I have seen his
ways, and will heal him: I will lead
him also, and restore comforts unto
him and to his mourners. Peace,
peace to him that is far off, and to
him that is near, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and
I will heal him. But the wicked are
like the troubled sea, when it cannot
rest, whose waters cast up mire and
dirt. There is no peace, saith my
God, to the wicked. Wherefore have
we fasted, say they, and thou seest
not? wherefore have we afflicted our
soul, and thou takest no knowledge?
Behold, in the day of your fast ye
find pleasure, and exact all your labours.
Behold, ye fast for strife and
debate, and to smite with the fist of
wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye
do this day, to make your voice to be
heard on high.</p>

<p>Is it such a fast that I have chosen?
a day for a man to afflict his soul? is
it to bow down his head as a bulrush,
and to spread sackcloth and ashes
under him? wilt thou call this a fast,
and an acceptable day to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>?
Is not this the fast that I have chosen?
to loose the bands of wickedness, to
undo the heavy burdens, and to let
the oppressed go free, and that ye
break every yoke? Is it not to deal
thy bread to the hungry, and that thou
bring the poor that are cast out to thy
house? when thou seest the naked,
that thou cover him; and that thou
hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
Then shall thy light break forth as
the morning, and thine health shall
spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness
shall go before thee; the
glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall be thy rereward.</p>

<p>If thou turn away thy foot from the
sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on
my holy day; and call the sabbath a
delight, the holy of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, honourable;
and shalt honour him, not
doing thine own ways, nor finding
thine own pleasure, nor speaking
thine own words: then shalt thou delight
thyself in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and I will
cause thee to ride upon the high
places of the earth, and feed thee
with the heritage of Jacob thy father:
for the mouth of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath
spoken it.</p>

<p>Arise, shine; for thy light is come,
and the glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is risen
upon thee. For, behold, the darkness
shall cover the earth, and gross darkness
the people: but the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall
arise upon thee, and his glory shall be
seen upon thee. And the Gentiles
shall come to thy light, and kings to
the brightness of thy rising.</p>

<p>The sun shall be no more thy light
by day; neither for brightness shall
the moon give light unto thee: but the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall be unto thee an everlasting
light, and thy God thy glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spirit of the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span> is upon
me; because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath anointed
me to preach good tidings unto the
meek; he hath sent me to bind up the
brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to
the captives, and the opening of the
prison to them that are bound; to proclaim
the acceptable year of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and the day of vengeance of our God;
to comfort all that mourn; to appoint
unto them that mourn in Zion, to give
unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of
joy for mourning, the garment of
praise for the spirit of heaviness; that
they might be called trees of righteousness,
the planting of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
that he might be glorified.</p>

<p>I will greatly rejoice in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
my soul shall be joyful in my God;
for he hath clothed me with the garments
of salvation, he hath covered
me with the robe of righteousness, as
a bridegroom decketh himself with
ornaments, and as a bride adorneth
herself with her jewels. For as the
earth bringeth forth her bud, and as
the garden causeth the things that are
sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord
<span class="smcap">God</span> will cause righteousness and
praise to spring forth before all the
nations.</p>

<p>I will mention the lovingkindnesses
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and the praises of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, according to all that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
hath bestowed on us, and the great
goodness toward the house of Israel,
which he hath bestowed on them according
to his mercies, and according
to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
For he said, Surely they are
my people, children that will not lie:
so he was their Saviour. In all their
affliction he was afflicted, and the
angel of his presence saved them: in
his love and in his pity he redeemed
them; and he bare them, and carried
them all the days of old.</p>

<small>WORDS OF JEREMIAH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Jeremiah 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE words of Jeremiah the son
of Hilkiah, to whom the word
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came in the days
of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah.
It came also in the days of Jehoiakim
the son of Josiah, unto the
end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah
the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto
the carrying away of Jerusalem captive
in the fifth month.</div>

<p>Hear ye the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, O
house of Jacob, and all the families
of the house of Israel: thus saith
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, What iniquity have your
fathers found in me, that they are
gone far from me, and have walked
after vanity, and are become vain?
For my people have committed two
evils; they have forsaken me the
fountain of living waters, and hewed
them out cisterns, broken cisterns,
that can hold no water.</p>

<p>Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth
her appointed times; and the turtle
and the crane and the swallow
observe the time of their coming; but
my people know not the judgment of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>Is there no balm in Gilead; is there
no physician there? why then is not
the health of the daughter of my people
recovered? Oh that my head
were waters, and mine eyes a fountain
of tears, that I might weep day
and night for the slain of the daughter
of my people!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Let not the
wise man glory in his wisdom, neither
let the mighty man glory in his might,
let not the rich man glory in his
riches: but let him that glorieth glory
in this, that he understandeth and
knoweth me, that I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> which
exercise lovingkindness, judgment,
and righteousness, in the earth: for
in these things I delight, saith the

<small>THE POTTER'S VESSEL</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Jeremiah 18</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE word which came to Jeremiah
from the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, saying,
Arise, and go down to the potter's
house, and there I will cause
thee to hear my words. Then I went
down to the potter's house, and, behold,
he wrought a work on the
wheels. And the vessel that he made
of clay was marred in the hand of the
potter: so he made it again another
vessel, as seemed good to the potter to
make it. Then the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
came to me, saying, O house of Israel,
cannot I do with you as this potter?
saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Behold, as the clay
is in the potter's hand, so are ye in
mine hand, O house of Israel. At
what instant I shall speak concerning
a nation, and concerning a kingdom,
to pluck up, and to pull down, and to
destroy it; if that nation, against
whom I have pronounced, turn from
their evil, I will repent of the evil
that I thought to do unto them. And
at what instant I shall speak concerning
a nation, and concerning a kingdom,
to build and to plant it; if it do
evil in my sight, that it obey not my
voice, then I will repent of the good,
wherewith I said I would benefit
them.</div>

<p>Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Go and get a
potter's earthen bottle, and take of
the ancients of the people, and of the
ancients of the priests; and go forth
unto the valley of the son of Hinnom,
which is by the entry of the east gate,
and proclaim there the words that I
shall tell thee, and say, Hear ye the
word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, O kings of Judah,
and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus
saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel;
Behold, I will bring evil upon
this place, the which whosoever heareth,
his ears shall tingle. Then shalt
thou break the bottle in the sight of
the men that go with thee, and shalt
say unto them, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of
hosts; Even so will I break this people
and this city, as one breaketh a
potter's vessel, that cannot be made
whole again: and they shall bury
them in Tophet, till there be no place
to bury.</p>

<p>Now Pashur the son of Immer the
priest, who was also chief governor
in the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, heard that
Jeremiah prophesied these things.
Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet,
and put him in the stocks that
were in the high gate of Benjamin,
which was by the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
And it came to pass on the morrow,
that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah
out of the stocks. Then said
Jeremiah unto him, Thou, Pashur,
and all that dwell in thine house
shall go into captivity: and thou shalt
come to Babylon, and there thou shalt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
die, and shalt be buried there, thou,
and all thy friends, to whom thou hast
prophesied lies.</p>

<p>The word that came to Jeremiah
from the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, saying, Thus speaketh
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of Israel, saying, Write
thee all the words that I have spoken
unto thee in a book. For, lo, the days
come, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that I will bring
again the captivity of my people Israel
and Judah, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: and
I will cause them to return to the land
that I gave to their fathers, and they
shall possess it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath appeared of old
unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved
thee with an everlasting love: therefore
with lovingkindness have I
drawn thee.</p>

<p>Hear the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, O ye
nations, and declare it in the isles afar
off, and say, He that scattered Israel
will gather him, and keep him, as a
shepherd doth his flock.</p>

<p>Behold, the days come, saith the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that I will make a new covenant
with the house of Israel, and with the
house of Judah: not according to the
covenant that I made with their fathers
in the day that I took them by
the hand to bring them out of the land
of Egypt; which my covenant they
brake, although I was an husband
unto them, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: but this
shall be the covenant that I will make
with the house of Israel; After those
days, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I will put my
law in their inward parts, and write
it in their hearts; and will be their
God, and they shall be my people.
And they shall teach no more every
man his neighbour, and every man
his brother, saying, Know the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>:
for they shall all know me, from the
least of them unto the greatest of
them, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: for I will forgive
their iniquity, and I will remember
their sin no more.</p>

<p>Behold, the days come, saith the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that I will perform that good
thing which I have promised unto the
house of Israel and to the house of
Judah. In those days, and at that
time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness
to grow up unto David; and
he shall execute judgment and righteousness
in the land. In those days
shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem
shall dwell safely: and this is the
name wherewith she shall be called,
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our righteousness.</p>

<small>JEREMIAH IS PERSECUTED</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Jeremiah 37</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, that when
the army of the Chaldeans
was broken up from Jerusalem
for fear of Pharaoh's army, then
Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem
to go into the land of Benjamin,
to separate himself thence in the
midst of the people. And when he
was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain
of the ward was there, whose
name was Irijah; and he took Jeremiah
the prophet, saying, Thou fallest
away to the Chaldeans. Then
said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall
not away to the Chaldeans. But he
hearkened not to him: so Irijah took
Jeremiah, and brought him to the
princes. Wherefore the princes were
wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him,
and put him in prison in the house of
Jonathan the scribe: for they had
made that the prison.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>When Jeremiah was entered into
the dungeon, and into the cabins, and
had remained there many days, Zedekiah
the king sent, and took him out:
and the king asked him secretly in his
house, and said, Is there any word
from the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? And Jeremiah said,
There is: for, said he, thou shalt be
delivered into the hand of the king of
Babylon. Then Zedekiah the king
commanded that they should commit
Jeremiah into the court of the prison,
and that they should give him daily a
piece of bread out of the bakers'
street, until all the bread in the city
were spent. So Jeremiah abode in
the court of the prison until the day
that Jerusalem was taken: and he
was there when Jerusalem was taken.</p>

<p>And Jeremiah wrote these words
in his lamentations: It is of the
<span class="smcap">Lord's</span> mercies that we are not consumed,
because his compassions fail
not. They are new every morning:
great is thy faithfulness.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is my portion, saith my
soul; therefore will I hope in him.
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is good unto them that wait
for him, to the soul that seeketh him.
It is good that a man should both hope
and quietly wait for the salvation of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. It is good for a man that
he bear the yoke in his youth. He
sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because
he hath borne it upon him. He
putteth his mouth in the dust; if so
be there may be hope. He giveth his
cheek to him that smiteth him: he is
filled full with reproach.</p>

<p>For the Lord will not cast off for
ever: but though he cause grief, yet
will he have compassion according to
the multitude of his mercies. For he
doth not afflict willingly nor grieve
the children of men.</p>

<p>Wherefore doth a living man complain,
a man for the punishment of
his sins? Let us search and try our
ways, and turn again to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
Let us lift up our heart with our
hands unto God in the heavens.</p>

<small>EZEKIEL AMONG THE CAPTIVES</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Ezekiel 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW it came to pass in the thirtieth
year, in the fourth
month, in the fifth day of
the month, as I was among the captives
by the river of Chebar, that the
heavens were opened, and I saw
visions of God. And he said unto me,
Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and
I will speak unto thee. And the spirit
entered into me when he spake unto
me, and set me upon my feet, that I
heard him that spake unto me. And
he said unto me, Son of man, I send
thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious
nation that hath rebelled
against me: they and their fathers
have transgressed against me, even
unto this very day. Therefore say,
Thus saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>; Although
I have cast them far off among the
heathen, and although I have scattered
them among the countries, yet
will I be to them as a little sanctuary
in the countries where they shall
come. Therefore say, Thus saith the
Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>; I will even gather you
from the people, and assemble you
out of the countries where ye have
been scattered, and I will give you
the land of Israel. And I will give
them one heart, and I will put a new
spirit within you; and I will take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
stony heart out of their flesh, and will
give them an heart of flesh: that they
may walk in my statutes, and keep
mine ordinances, and do them: and
they shall be my people, and I will
be their God.</div>

<p>Afterwards the spirit took me up,
and brought me in a vision by the
Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them
of the captivity. So the vision that
I had seen went up from me. Then I
spake unto them of the captivity all
the things that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had shewed

<small>EVERY MAN JUDGED BY HIS OWN ACTIONS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Ezekiel 14</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came
again to me, saying, Son of
man, when the land sinneth
against me by trespassing grievously,
then will I stretch out mine hand upon
it, and will break the staff of the
bread thereof, and will send famine
upon it, and will cut off man and beast
from it: though these three men,
Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it,
they should deliver but their own
souls by their righteousness, saith the
Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>. If I cause noisome beasts
to pass through the land, and they
spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no
man may pass through because of the
beasts: though these three men were
in it, as I live, saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>,
they shall deliver neither sons nor
daughters; they only shall be delivered,
but the land shall be desolate.
Or if I bring a sword upon that land,
and say, Sword, go through the land;
so that I cut off man and beast from
it: though these three men were in
it, as I live, saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>, they
shall deliver neither sons nor daughters,
but they only shall be delivered
themselves. Or if I send a pestilence
into that land, and pour out my fury
upon it in blood, to cut off from it
man and beast: though Noah, Daniel,
and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the
Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>, they shall deliver neither
son nor daughter; they shall but deliver
their own souls by their righteousness.</div>

<p>The word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came unto
me again, saying, What mean ye,
that ye use this proverb concerning
the land of Israel, saying, The fathers
have eaten sour grapes, and the
children's teeth are set on edge? As
I live, saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>, ye shall
not have occasion any more to use
this proverb in Israel. Behold, all
souls are mine; as the soul of the father,
so also the soul of the son is
mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall
die. But if a man be just, and do that
which is lawful and right, and hath
not oppressed any, but hath restored
to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled
none by violence, hath given his bread
to the hungry, and hath covered the
naked with a garment; he that hath
not given forth upon usury, neither
hath taken any increase, that hath
withdrawn his hand from iniquity,
hath executed true judgment between
man and man, hath walked in my
statutes, and hath kept my judgments,
to deal truly; he is just, he shall
surely live, saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>If he beget a son that is a robber,
a shedder of blood, and that doeth not
any of those duties, shall he then live?
he shall not live; he shall surely die;
his blood shall be upon him. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his
father's sins which he hath done, and
considereth, and doeth not such like,
but hath given his bread to the hungry,
and hath covered the naked with
a garment, that hath executed my
judgments, hath walked in my statutes;
he shall not die for the iniquity
of his father, he shall surely live.
Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son
bear the iniquity of the father?
When the son hath done that which is
lawful and right, and hath kept all
my statutes, and hath done them, he
shall surely live. The soul that sinneth,
it shall die. The son shall not
bear the iniquity of the father, neither
shall the father bear the iniquity of
the son: the righteousness of the
righteous shall be upon him, and the
wickedness of the wicked shall be
upon him. But if the wicked will
turn from all his sins that he hath
committed, and keep all my statutes,
and do that which is lawful and right,
he shall surely live, he shall not die.
All his transgressions that he hath
committed, they shall not be mentioned
unto him: in his righteousness
that he hath done he shall live. Have
I any pleasure at all that the wicked
should die? saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>: and
not that he should return from his
ways, and live? But when the righteous
turneth away from his righteousness,
and committeth iniquity, and
doeth according to all the abominations
that the wicked man doeth, shall
he live? All his righteousness that
he hath done shall not be mentioned:
in his trespass that he hath trespassed,
and in his sin that he hath
sinned, in them shall he die.</p>

<p>Therefore I will judge you, O
house of Israel, every one according
to his ways, saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>. Repent,
and turn yourselves from all
your transgressions; so iniquity shall
not be your ruin. Cast away from
you all your transgressions, whereby
ye have transgressed; and make you
a new heart and a new spirit: for why
will ye die, O house of Israel? For
I have no pleasure in the death of
him that dieth, saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>:
wherefore turn yourselves, and live
ye.</p>

<small>THE VALLEY OF DRY BONES</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Ezekiel 37</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was upon
me, and carried me out in the
spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and set me
down in the midst of the valley which
was full of bones, and caused me to
pass by them round about: and, behold,
there were very many in the
open valley; and, lo, they were very
dry. And he said unto me, Son of
man, can these bones live? And I answered,
O Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>, thou knowest.
Again he said unto me, Prophesy
upon these bones, and say unto them,
O ye dry bones, hear the word of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Thus saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span> unto
these bones; Behold, I will cause
breath to enter into you, and ye shall
live: and I will lay sinews upon you,
and will bring up flesh upon you, and
cover you with skin, and put breath
in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall
know that I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. So I
prophesied as I was commanded: and
as I prophesied, there was a noise,
and behold a shaking, and the bones
came together, bone to his bone. And
when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
flesh came up upon them, and the

was no breath in them. Then said

prophesy, son of man, and say to the
wind, Thus saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>; Come
from the four winds, O breath, and
breathe upon these slain, that they
may live. So I prophesied as he commanded
me, and the breath came into
them, and they lived, and stood up
upon their feet, an exceeding great
army.</div>

<p>Then he said unto me, Son of man,
these bones are the whole house of Israel:
behold, they say, Our bones are
dried, and our hope is lost: we are
cut off for our parts. Therefore
prophesy and say unto them, Thus

<small>DANIEL AND HIS THREE
FRIENDS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Daniel 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>IN the third year of the reign of
Jehoiakim king of Judah came
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king
of Judah into his hand, with part of
the vessels of the house of God: which
he carried into the land of Shinar to
the house of his god; and he brought
the vessels into the treasure house of
his god. And the king spake unto
Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs,
that he should bring certain of the
children of Israel, and of the king's
seed, and of the princes; children in
whom was no blemish, but well favoured,
and skilful in all wisdom, and
cunning in knowledge, and understanding
science, and such as had
ability in them to stand in the king's
palace, and whom they might teach
the learning and the tongue of the
Chaldeans. Now among these were
of the children of Judah, Daniel,
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
unto whom the prince of the eunuchs
gave names: for he gave unto Daniel
the name of Belteshazzar; and to
Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael,
of Meshach; and to Azariah,
of Abed-nego.</div>

<p>As for these four children, God
gave them knowledge and skill in all
learning and wisdom: and Daniel
had understanding in all visions and
dreams. Now at the end of the days
that the king had said he should bring
them in, then the prince of the eunuchs
brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
And the king communed
with them; and among them
all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah,
Mishael, and Azariah: therefore
stood they before the king. And
in all matters of wisdom and understanding,
that the king enquired of
them, he found them ten times better
than all the magicians and astrologers
that were in all his realm.</p>

<small>NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S DREAM</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Daniel 2</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND in the second year of his
reign Nebuchadnezzar dreamed
dreams, wherewith his
spirit was troubled, and his sleep
brake from him. Then the king commanded
to call the magicians, and the
astrologers, and the sorcerers, and
the Chaldeans, for to shew the king
his dreams. So they came and stood
before the king. And the king said
unto them, I have dreamed a dream,
and my spirit was troubled to know
the dream. Then spake the Chaldeans
to the king in Syriack, O king,
live for ever: tell thy servants the
dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
The king answered and
said to the Chaldeans, The thing is
gone from me: if ye will not make
known unto me the dream, with the
interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut
in pieces, and your houses shall be
made a dunghill. But if ye shew the
dream, and the interpretation thereof,
ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards
and great honour: therefore
shew me the dream, and the interpretation
thereof. They answered again
and said, Let the king tell his servants
the dream, and we will shew the interpretation
of it. The king answered
and said, I know of certainty
that ye would gain the time, because
ye see the thing is gone from me.
But if ye will not make known unto
me the dream, there is but one decree
for you: for ye have prepared lying
and corrupt words to speak before
me, till the time be changed: therefore
tell me the dream, and I shall
know that ye can shew me the interpretation
thereof. The Chaldeans
answered before the king, and said,
There is not a man upon the earth
that can shew the king's matter:
therefore there is no king, lord, nor
ruler, that asked such things at any
magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
And it is a rare thing that the king requireth,
and there is none other that
can shew it before the king, except
the gods, whose dwelling is not with
flesh.</div>

<p>For this cause the king was angry
and very furious, and commanded to
destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
And the decree went forth that the
wise men should be slain; and they
sought Daniel and his fellows to be
slain. Then Daniel answered with
counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
captain of the king's guard, which
was gone forth to slay the wise men
of Babylon, Why is the decree so
hasty from the king? Then Arioch
made the thing known to Daniel.
Then Daniel went in, and desired of
the king that he would give him time,
and that he would shew the king the
interpretation. Then Daniel went to
his house, and made the thing known
to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
his companions: that they would desire
mercies of the God of heaven
concerning this secret; that Daniel
and his fellows should not perish with
the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</p>

<p>Then was the secret revealed unto
Daniel in a night vision. Then
Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel answered and said, Blessed
be the name of God for ever and
ever: for wisdom and might are his:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
and he changeth the times and the
seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth
up kings: he giveth wisdom unto
the wise, and knowledge to them that
know understanding: he revealeth
the deep and secret things: he knoweth
what is in the darkness, and the
light dwelleth with him. I thank
thee, and praise thee, O thou God of
my fathers, who hast given me wisdom
and might, and hast made known
unto me now what we desired of thee:
for thou hast now made known unto
us the king's matter.</p>

<p>Therefore Daniel went in unto
Arioch, whom the king had ordained
to destroy the wise men of Babylon:
he went and said thus unto him; Destroy
not the wise men of Babylon:
bring me in before the king, and I will
shew unto the king the interpretation.
Then Arioch brought in Daniel before
the king in haste, and said thus unto
him, I have found a man of the captives
of Judah, that will make known
unto the king the interpretation. The
king answered and said to Daniel,
whose name was Belteshazzar, Art
thou able to make known unto me the
dream which I have seen, and the
interpretation thereof? Daniel answered
in the presence of the king,
and said, The secret which the king
hath demanded cannot the wise men,
the astrologers, the magicians, the
soothsayers, shew unto the king; but
there is a God in heaven that revealeth
secrets, and maketh known to the
king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in
the latter days. Thy dream, and the
visions of thy head upon thy bed, are
these; as for thee, O king, thy
thoughts came into thy mind upon thy
bed, what should come to pass hereafter:
and he that revealeth secrets
maketh known to thee what shall
come to pass. But as for me, this secret
is not revealed to me for any wisdom
that I have more than any living,
but for their sakes that shall make
known the interpretation to the king,
and that thou mightest know the
thoughts of thy heart.</p>

<p>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold
a great image. This great image,
whose brightness was excellent, stood
before thee; and the form thereof
was terrible. This image's head was
of fine gold, his breast and his arms
of silver, his belly and his thighs of
brass, his legs of iron, his feet part
of iron and part of clay. Thou sawest
till that a stone was cut out without
hands, which smote the image
upon his feet that were of iron and
clay, and brake them to pieces. Then
was the iron, the clay, the brass, the
silver, and the gold, broken to pieces
together, and became like the chaff of
the summer threshingfloors; and the
wind carried them away, that no
place was found for them: and the
stone that smote the image became a
great mountain, and filled the whole
earth. This is the dream; and we
will tell the interpretation thereof
before the king.</p>

<p>Thou, O king, art a king of kings:
for the God of heaven hath given thee
a kingdom, power, and strength, and
glory. And wheresoever the children
of men dwell, the beasts of the field
and the fowls of the heaven hath he
given into thine hand, and hath made
thee ruler over them all. Thou art
this head of gold. And after thee
shall arise another kingdom inferior
to thee, and another third kingdom
of brass, which shall bear rule over
all the earth. And the fourth kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
shall be strong as iron: forasmuch
as iron breaketh in pieces and
subdueth all things: and as iron that
breaketh all these, shall it break in
pieces and bruise. And whereas thou
sawest the feet and toes, part of potter's
clay, and part of iron, the kingdom
shall be divided; but there shall
be in it of the strength of the iron,
forasmuch as thou sawest the iron
mixed with miry clay. And as the
toes of the feet were part of iron, and
part of clay, so the kingdom shall be
partly strong, and partly broken.
And whereas thou sawest iron mixed
with miry clay, they shall mingle
themselves with the seed of men: but
they shall not cleave one to another,
even as iron is not mixed with clay.
And in the days of these kings shall
the God of heaven set up a kingdom,
which shall never be destroyed: and
the kingdom shall not be left to other
people, but it shall break in pieces
and consume all these kingdoms, and
it shall stand for ever. Forasmuch
as thou sawest that the stone was cut
out of the mountain without hands,
and that it brake in pieces the iron,
the brass, the clay, the silver, and
the gold; the great God hath made
known to the king what shall come to
pass hereafter: and the dream is certain,
and the interpretation thereof
sure.</p>

<p>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell
upon his face, and worshipped Daniel,
and commanded that they should
offer an oblation and sweet odours
unto him. The king answered unto
Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that
your God is a God of gods, and a
Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets,
seeing thou couldest reveal this
secret. Then the king made Daniel
a great man, and gave him many
great gifts, and made him ruler over
the whole province of Babylon, and
chief of the governors over all the
wise men of Babylon. Then Daniel
requested of the king, and he set
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
over the affairs of the province of
Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate
of the king.</p>

<small>THE THREE HEBREWS IN THE
FURNACE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Daniel 3</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NEBUCHADNEZZAR the king
made an image of gold,
whose height was threescore
cubits, and the breadth thereof six
cubits: he set it up in the plain of
Dura, in the province of Babylon.
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent
to gather together the princes, the
governors, and the captains, the
judges, the treasurers, the counsellors,
the sheriffs, and all the rulers
of the provinces, to come to the dedication
of the image which Nebuchadnezzar
the king had set up. Then the
princes, the governors, and captains,
the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors,
the sheriffs, and all the rulers
of the provinces, were gathered together
unto the dedication of the
image that Nebuchadnezzar the king
had set up; and they stood before the
image that Nebuchadnezzar had set
up. Then an herald cried aloud, To
you it is commanded, O people, nations,
and languages, that at what
time ye hear the sound of the cornet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer,
and all kinds of musick, ye fall
down and worship the golden image
that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath
set up: and whoso falleth not down
and worshippeth shall the same hour
be cast into the midst of a burning
fiery furnace. Therefore at that
time, when all the people heard the
sound of the musick, all the people,
the nations, and the languages, fell
down and worshipped the golden image
that Nebuchadnezzar the king
had set up.</div>

<p>Wherefore at that time certain
Chaldeans came near, and accused
the Jews. They spake and said to the
king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live
for ever. Thou, O king, hast made a
decree, that every man that shall hear
the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,
sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and
all kinds of musick, shall fall down
and worship the golden image: and
whoso falleth not down and worshippeth,
that he should be cast into the
midst of a burning fiery furnace.
There are certain Jews whom thou
hast set over the affairs of the province
of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abed-nego; these men, O king,
have not regarded thee: they serve
not thy gods, nor worship the golden
image which thou hast set up.</p>

<p>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of
fury, and the form of his visage was
changed against Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abed-nego: therefore he spake,
and commanded that they should heat
the furnace seven times more than it
was wont to be heated. And he commanded
the most mighty men that
were in his army to bind Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast
them into the burning fiery furnace.
Then these men were bound in their
coats, their hosen, and their hats, and
their other garments, and were cast
into the midst of the furnace. Therefore
because the king's commandment
was urgent, and the furnace exceeding
hot, the flame of the fire slew
those men that took up Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego. And these
three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego, fell down bound into the
midst of the fiery furnace. Then
Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied,
and rose up in haste, and
spake, and said unto his counsellors,
Did not we cast three men
bound into the midst of the fire?
They answered and said unto the
king, True, O king. He answered
and said, Lo, I see four men loose,
walking in the midst of the fire, and
they have no hurt; and the form of
the fourth is like the Son of God.</p>

<p>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near
to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace,
and spake, and said, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants
of the most high God, come forth, and
come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abed-nego, came forth of
the midst of the fire. And the
princes, governors, and captains, and
the king's counsellors, being gathered
together, saw these men, upon
whose bodies the fire had no power,
nor was an hair of their head singed,
neither were their coats changed, nor
the smell of fire had passed on them.
Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and
said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath
sent his angel, and delivered his servants
that trusted in him, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
changed the king's word, and yielded
their bodies, that they might not
serve nor worship any god, except
their own God. Therefore I make a
decree, That every people, nation,
and language, which speak any thing
amiss against the God of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut
in pieces, and their houses shall be
made a dunghill: because there is no
other God that can deliver after this
sort. Then the king promoted Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego, in
the province of Babylon.</p>

<small>BELSHAZZAR'S FEAST</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Daniel 5</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>BELSHAZZAR the king made
a great feast to a thousand of
his lords, and drank wine before
the thousand. Whiles he tasted
the wine, he commanded to bring the
golden and silver vessels which his
father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out
of the temple which was in Jerusalem;
that the king, and his princes,
and his wives, might drink therein.
Then they brought the golden vessels
that were taken out of the temple of
the house of God which was at Jerusalem;
and the king, and his princes,
and his wives, drank in them. They
drank wine, and praised the gods of
gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron,
of wood, and of stone. In the same
hour came forth fingers of a man's
hand, and wrote over against the candlestick
upon the plaister of the wall
of the king's palace: and the king saw
the part of the hand that wrote.
Then the king's countenance was
changed, and his thoughts troubled
him, so that the joints of his loins
were loosed, and his knees smote one
against another. The king cried
aloud to bring in the astrologers, the
Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And
the king spake, and said to the wise
men of Babylon, Whosoever shall
read this writing, and shew me
the interpretation thereof, shall be
clothed with scarlet, and have a chain
of gold about his neck, and shall be
the third ruler in the kingdom. Then
came in all the king's wise men: but
they could not read the writing, nor
make known to the king the interpretation
thereof. Then was king Belshazzar
greatly troubled, and his
countenance was changed in him, and
his lords were astonied.</div>

<p>Now the queen by reason of the
words of the king and his lords came
into the banquet house: and the queen
spake and said, O king, live for ever:
let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor
let thy countenance be changed: there
is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is
the spirit of the holy gods; and in
the days of thy father light and understanding
and wisdom, like the wisdom
of the gods, was found in him;
whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy
father, the king, I say, thy father,
made master of the magicians, astrologers,
Chaldeans, and soothsayers;
forasmuch as an excellent spirit,
and knowledge, and understanding,
interpreting of dreams, and shewing
of hard sentences, and dissolving of
doubts, were found in the same Daniel,
whom the king named Belteshazzar:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
now let Daniel be called, and he
will shew the interpretation.</p>

<div class="caption">DANIEL'S VISION, BY REMBRANDT<br />

<span class='location'>IN THE BERLIN MUSEUM</span></div>
</div>

<p>Then was Daniel brought in before
the king. And the king spake and
said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel,
which art of the children of the
captivity of Judah, whom the king
my father brought out of Jewry? I
have even heard of thee, that the
spirit of the gods is in thee, and that
light and understanding and excellent
wisdom is found in thee. And
now the wise men, the astrologers,
have been brought in before me, that
they should read this writing, and
make known unto me the interpretation
thereof: but they could not shew
the interpretation of the thing: and
I have heard of thee, that thou canst
make interpretations, and dissolve
doubts: now if thou canst read the
writing, and make known to me the
interpretation thereof, thou shalt be
clothed with scarlet, and have a chain
of gold about thy neck, and shalt be
the third ruler in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Then Daniel answered and said
before the king, Let thy gifts be to
thyself, and give thy rewards to another;
yet I will read the writing unto
the king, and make known to him the
interpretation. O thou king, the
most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar
thy father a kingdom, and majesty,
and glory, and honour: and for the
majesty that he gave him, all people,
nations, and languages, trembled
and feared before him: whom he
would he slew; and whom he would
he kept alive; and whom he would
he set up; and whom he would he put
down. But when his heart was lifted
up, and his mind hardened in pride,
he was deposed from his kingly
throne, and they took his glory from
him: and he was driven from the sons
of men; and his heart was made like
the beasts, and his dwelling was with
the wild asses: they fed him with
grass like oxen, and his body was wet
with the dew of heaven; till he knew
that the most high God ruled in the
kingdom of men, and that he appointeth
over it whomsoever he will. And
thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not
humbled thine heart, though thou
knewest all this; but hast lifted up
thyself against the Lord of heaven;
and they have brought the vessels of
his house before thee, and thou, and
thy lords, and thy wives, have drunk
wine in them; and thou hast praised
the gods of silver, and gold, of brass,
iron, wood, and stone, which see not,
nor hear, nor know: and the God in
whose hand thy breath is, and whose
are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:
then was the part of the hand
sent from him; and this writing was
written. And this is the writing that
was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation
of the thing: MENE;
God hath numbered thy kingdom,
and finished it. TEKEL; Thou art
weighed in the balances, and art
found wanting. PERES; Thy kingdom
is divided, and given to the
Medes and Persians.</p>

<p>Then commanded Belshazzar, and
they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and
put a chain of gold about his neck,
and made a proclamation concerning
him, that he should be the third ruler
in the kingdom.</p>

<p>In that night was Belshazzar the
king of the Chaldeans slain. And Darius
the Median took the kingdom,
being about threescore and two years
old.</p>

<small>DANIEL IN THE LIONS' DEN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Daniel 6</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>IT pleased Darius to set over the
kingdom an hundred and twenty
princes, which should be over
the whole kingdom; and over these
three presidents; of whom Daniel
was first: that the princes might give
accounts unto them, and the king
should have no damage. Then this
Daniel was preferred above the presidents
and princes, because an excellent
spirit was in him; and the king
thought to set him over the whole
realm. Then the presidents and
princes sought to find occasion
against Daniel concerning the kingdom;
but they could find none occasion
nor fault; forasmuch as he was
faithful, neither was there any error
or fault found in him. Then said
these men, We shall not find any occasion
against this Daniel, except we
find it against him concerning the
law of his God. Then these presidents
and princes assembled together
to the king, and said thus unto him,
King Darius, live for ever. All the
presidents of the kingdom, the governors,
and the princes, the counsellors,
and the captains, have consulted together
to establish a royal statute,
and to make a firm decree, that whosoever
shall ask a petition of any
God or man for thirty days, save of
thee, O king, he shall be cast into the
den of lions. Now, O king, establish
the decree, and sign the writing, that
it be not changed, according to the
law of the Medes and Persians, which
altereth not. Wherefore king Darius
signed the writing and the decree.</div>

<p>Now when Daniel knew that the
writing was signed, he went into his
house; and his windows being open
in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he
kneeled upon his knees three times
a day, and prayed, and gave thanks
before his God, as he did aforetime.
Then these men assembled, and found
Daniel praying and making supplication
before his God. Then they
came near, and spake before the king
concerning the king's decree; Hast
thou not signed a decree, that every
man that shall ask a petition of any
God or man within thirty days, save
of thee, O king, shall be cast into the
den of lions? The king answered
and said, The thing is true, according
to the law of the Medes and Persians,
which altereth not. Then answered
they and said before the king,
That Daniel, which is of the children
of the captivity of Judah, regardeth
not thee, O king, nor the decree that
thou hast signed, but maketh his petition
three times a day. Then the
king, when he heard these words, was
sore displeased with himself, and set
his heart on Daniel to deliver him:
and he laboured till the going down
of the sun to deliver him. Then
these men assembled unto the king,
and said unto the king, Know, O king,
that the law of the Medes and Persians
is, That no decree nor statute
which the king establisheth may be
changed. Then the king commanded,
and they brought Daniel, and cast
him into the den of lions. Now the
king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy
God whom thou servest continually,
he will deliver thee. And a stone
was brought, and laid upon the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
of the den; and the king sealed it with
his own signet, and with the signet
of his lords; that the purpose might
not be changed concerning Daniel.</p>

</div>

<p>Then the king went to his palace,
and passed the night fasting: neither
were instruments of musick brought
before him: and his sleep went from
him. Then the king arose very early
in the morning, and went in haste
unto the den of lions. And when he
came to the den, he cried with a lamentable
voice unto Daniel: and the
king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel,
servant of the living God, is thy
God, whom thou servest continually,
able to deliver thee from the lions?
Then said Daniel unto the king, O
king, live for ever. My God hath sent
his angel, and hath shut the lions'
mouths, that they have not hurt me:
forasmuch as before him innocency
was found in me; and also before
thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
Then was the king exceeding glad
for him, and commanded that they
should take Daniel up out of the den.
So Daniel was taken up out of the
den, and no manner of hurt was found
upon him, because he believed in his
God.</p>

<p>And the king commanded, and they
brought those men which had accused
Daniel, and they cast them into the
den of lions, them, their children,
and their wives; and the lions had
the mastery of them, and brake all
their bones in pieces or ever they
came at the bottom of the den. Then
king Darius wrote unto all people,
nations, and languages, that dwell in
all the earth; Peace be multiplied
unto you. I make a decree, That in
every dominion of my kingdom men
tremble and fear before the God of
Daniel: for he is the living God, and
stedfast for ever, and his kingdom
that which shall not be destroyed, and
his dominion shall be even unto the
end. He delivereth and rescueth, and
he worketh signs and wonders in
heaven and in earth, who hath delivered
Daniel from the power of the
lions.</p>

<p>So this Daniel prospered in the
reign of Darius, and in the reign of
Cyrus the Persian.</p>

<small>JONAH</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Jonah 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
came unto Jonah, saying,
Arise, go to Nineveh, that
great city, and cry against it; for
their wickedness is come up before
me. But Jonah rose up to flee unto
Tarshish from the presence of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and went down to Joppa; and
he found a ship going to Tarshish:
so he paid the fare thereof, and went
down into it, to go with them unto
Tarshish from the presence of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</div>

<p>But the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> sent out a great wind
into the sea, and there was a mighty
tempest in the sea, so that the ship
was like to be broken. Then the mariners
were afraid, and cried every
man unto his god, and cast forth the
wares that were in the ship into the
sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah
was gone down into the sides of the
ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
So the shipmaster came to him, and
said unto him, What meanest thou,
O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
if so be that God will think upon us,
that we perish not. And they said
every one to his fellow, Come, and let
us cast lots, that we may know for
whose cause this evil is upon us. So
they cast lots, and the lot fell upon
Jonah. Then said they unto him,
Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause
this evil is upon us; What is thine
occupation? and whence comest thou?
what is thy country? and of what people
art thou? And he said unto them,
I am an Hebrew; and I fear the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
the God of heaven, which hath made
the sea and the dry land. Then were
the men exceedingly afraid, and said
unto him, Why hast thou done this?
For the men knew that he fled from
the presence of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, because he
had told them.</p>

<p>Then said they unto him, What
shall we do unto thee, that the sea
may be calm unto us? for the sea
wrought, and was tempestuous. And
he said unto them, Take me up, and
cast me forth into the sea; so shall
the sea be calm unto you: for I know
that for my sake this great tempest
is upon you. Nevertheless the men
rowed hard to bring it to the land;
but they could not: for the sea
wrought, and was tempestuous against
them. Wherefore they cried unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said, We beseech thee, O
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, we beseech thee, let us not perish
for this man's life, and lay not
upon us innocent blood: for thou, O
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, hast done as it pleased thee.
So they took up Jonah, and cast him
forth into the sea: and the sea ceased
from her raging. Then the men
feared the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> exceedingly, and offered
a sacrifice unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
made vows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jonah 2</div>

<p>Now the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had prepared a great
fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah
was in the belly of the fish three days
and three nights. Then Jonah
prayed unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God out of
the fish's belly, and said, I cried by
reason of mine affliction unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and he heard me. Salvation
is of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake
unto the fish, and it vomited out
Jonah upon the dry land. And the
word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came unto Jonah
the second time, saying, Arise, go
unto Nineveh, that great city, and
preach unto it the preaching that I
bid thee. So Jonah arose, and went
unto Nineveh, according to the word
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Now Nineveh was an
exceeding great city of three days'
journey. And Jonah began to enter
into the city a day's journey, and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and
Nineveh shall be overthrown.</p>

<p>So the people of Nineveh believed
God, and proclaimed a fast, and put
on sackcloth, from the greatest of
them even to the least of them. For
word came unto the king of Nineveh,
and he arose from his throne, and he
laid his robe from him, and covered
him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
And he caused it to be proclaimed
and published through Nineveh by
the decree of the king and his nobles,
saying, Let neither man nor beast,
herd nor flock, taste any thing: let
them not feed, nor drink water: but
let man and beast be covered with
sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God:
yea, let them turn every one from his
evil way, and from the violence that
is in their hands. Who can tell if
God will turn and repent, and turn
away from his fierce anger, that we
perish not? And God saw their
works, that they turned from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
evil way; and God repented of the
evil, that he had said that he would do
unto them; and he did it not.</p>

<p>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly,
and he was very angry. And
he prayed unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said, I
pray thee, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, was not this my
saying, when I was yet in my country?
Therefore I fled before unto
Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a
gracious God, and merciful, slow to
anger, and of great kindness, and repentest
thee of the evil. Therefore
now, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, take, I beseech thee, my
life from me; for it is better for me to
die than to live.</p>

<p>Then said the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Doest thou
well to be angry? So Jonah went
out of the city, and sat on the east
side of the city, and there made him
a booth, and sat under it in the
shadow, till he might see what would
become of the city. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
God prepared a gourd, and made it
to come up over Jonah, that it might
be a shadow over his head, to deliver
him from his grief. So Jonah was
exceeding glad of the gourd. But
God prepared a worm when the morning
rose the next day, and it smote
the gourd that it withered. And it
came to pass, when the sun did arise,
that God prepared a vehement east
wind; and the sun beat upon the head
of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished
in himself to die, and said, It is better
for me to die than to live. And God
said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be
angry for the gourd? And he said,
I do well to be angry, even unto death.
Then said the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Thou hast had
pity on the gourd, for the which thou
hast not laboured, neither madest it
grow; which came up in a night, and
perished in a night: and should not I
spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein
are more than sixscore thousand
persons that cannot discern between
their right hand and their left hand;
and also much cattle?</p>

<small>THE ANNUNCIATION</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="150" height="173" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">IN the beginning
was the
Word, and
the Word was
with God, and
the Word was
God. The
same was in
the beginning
with God. All
things were
made by him; and without him was
not any thing made that was made.
In him was life; and the life was the
light of men. And the light shineth
in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
it not.</div>

<p>There was in the days of Herod,
the king of Judæa, a certain priest
named Zacharias, of the course of
Abia: and his wife was of the daughters
of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
And they were both righteous
before God, walking in all the
commandments and ordinances of the
Lord blameless. And they had no
child, and they both were now well
stricken in years. And it came to
pass, that while he executed the
priest's office before God in the order
of his course, according to the custom
of the priest's office, his lot
was to burn incense when he went
into the temple of the Lord. And
the whole multitude of the people
were praying without at the time of
incense. And there appeared unto
him an angel of the Lord standing
on the right side of the altar of incense.
And when Zacharias saw him,
he was troubled, and fear fell upon
him.</p>

</div>

<p>But the angel said unto him, Fear
not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is
heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall
bear thee a son, and thou shalt call
his name John. And thou shalt have
joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
at his birth. For he shall be
great in the sight of the Lord, and
shall drink neither wine nor strong
drink; and he shall be filled with the
Holy Ghost. And many of the children
of Israel shall he turn to the
Lord their God. And he shall go before
him in the spirit and power of
Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers
to the children, and the disobedient
to the wisdom of the just; to
make ready a people prepared for the
Lord.</p>

<p>And Zacharias said unto the angel,
Whereby shall I know this? for I am
an old man, and my wife well stricken
in years. And the angel answering
said unto him, I am Gabriel, that
stand in the presence of God; and am
sent to speak unto thee, and to shew
thee these glad tidings. And, behold,
thou shalt be dumb, and not able to
speak, until the day that these things
shall be performed, because thou believest
not my words, which shall be
fulfilled in their season. And the
people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled
that he tarried so long in the
temple. And when he came out, he
could not speak unto them: and they
perceived that he had seen a vision
in the temple: for he beckoned unto
them, and remained speechless. And
it came to pass, that, as soon as the
days of his ministration were accomplished,
he departed to his own house.</p>

<p>And in the sixth month the angel
Gabriel was sent from God unto a
city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to
a virgin espoused to a man whose
name was Joseph, of the house of
David; and the virgin's name was
Mary. And the angel came in unto
her, and said, Hail, thou that art
highly favoured, the Lord is with
thee: blessed art thou among women.
And when she saw him, she was troubled
at his saying, and cast in her
mind what manner of salutation this
should be. And the angel said unto
her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast
found favour with God. And, behold,
thou shalt bring forth a son, and shalt
call his name JESUS. He shall be
great, and shall be called the Son of
the Highest: and the Lord God shall
give unto him the throne of his father
David: and he shall reign over the
house of Jacob for ever; and of his
kingdom there shall be no end. Then
said Mary unto the angel, How shall
this be? And the angel answered and
said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
come upon thee, and the power of the
Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore
also that holy thing which shall
be born of thee shall be called the Son
of God. For with God nothing shall
be impossible. And Mary said, Behold
the handmaid of the Lord; be it
unto me according to thy word. And
the angel departed from her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 1</div>

<p>And Mary arose in those days, and
went into the hill country with haste,
into a city of Juda; and entered into
the house of Zacharias, and saluted
Elisabeth. And it came to pass, that
when Elisabeth heard the salutation
of Mary, she spake out with a loud
voice, and said, Blessed art thou
among women. And whence is this
to me, that the mother of my Lord
should come to me? And Mary said,</p>

<div class='poem'>

And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.<br />

For, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.<br />
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;<br />
And holy is his name.<br />
And his mercy is on them that fear him<br />
From generation to generation.<br />
He hath shewed strength with his arm;<br />
He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br />

And the rich he hath sent empty away.<br />
He hath holpen his servant Israel,<br />
In remembrance of his mercy;<br />

Lord had shewed great mercy upon

it came to pass, that on the eighth day
they came to circumcise the child;
and they called him Zacharias, after
the name of his father. And his mother
answered and said, Not so; but
he shall be called John. And they
said unto her, There is none of thy

And they made signs to his father,
how he would have him called. And
he asked for a writing table, and
wrote, saying, His name is John.
And they marvelled all. And his
mouth was opened immediately, and
his tongue loosed, and he spake, and
praised God. And fear came on all

these sayings were noised abroad
throughout all the hill country of Judæa.
And all they that heard them
laid them up in their hearts, saying,
What manner of child shall this be!

That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;<br />
To perform the mercy promised to our fathers,<br />
And to remember his holy covenant;<br />
The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,<br />
That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies<br />

In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.<br />

For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;<br />
To give knowledge of salvation unto his people<br />
By the remission of their sins,<br />
Through the tender mercy of our God;<br />
Whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,<br />
To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,<br />
To guide our feet into the way of peace.<br />

strong in spirit, and was in the deserts
till the day of his shewing unto

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass in those days,
that there went out a decree
from Cæsar Augustus, that all
the world should be taxed. And all
went to be taxed, every one into his
own city. And Joseph also went up
from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
into Judæa, unto the city of David,
which is called Bethlehem; (because
he was of the house and lineage
of David:) to be taxed, with Mary
his espoused wife, who was great with
child. And so it was, that, while they
were there, the days were accomplished
that she should be delivered.
And she brought forth her firstborn
son, and wrapped him in swaddling
clothes, and laid him in a manger; because
there was no room for them in
the inn.</div>

<p>And there were in the same country
shepherds abiding in the field, keeping
watch over their flock by night.
And, lo, the angel of the Lord came
upon them, and the glory of the Lord
shone round about them: and they
were sore afraid. And the angel said
unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I
bring you good tidings of great joy,
which shall be to all people. For unto
you is born this day in the city of David
a Saviour, which is Christ the
Lord. And this shall be a sign unto
you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped
in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
And suddenly there was with
the angel a multitude of the heavenly
host praising God, and saying, Glory
to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men. And it
came to pass, as the angels were gone
away from them into heaven, the
shepherds said one to another, Let us
now go even unto Bethlehem, and see
this thing which is come to pass,
which the Lord hath made known
unto us. And they came with haste,
and found Mary, and Joseph, and
the babe lying in a manger. And
when they had seen it, they made
known abroad the saying which was
told them concerning this child. And
all they that heard it wondered at
those things which were told them by
the shepherds. But Mary kept all
these things, and pondered them in
her heart. And the shepherds returned,
glorifying and praising God
for all the things that they had heard
and seen, as it was told unto them.
And when eight days were accomplished
for the circumcising of the
child, his name was called JESUS.</p>

A light to lighten the Gentiles,<br />
And the glory of thy people Israel.<br />
</div>

<p>And Joseph and his mother marvelled
at those things which were
spoken of him. And Simeon blessed
them, and said unto Mary his mother,
Behold, this child is set for the fall
and rising again of many in Israel;
and for a sign which shall be spoken
against; (yea, a sword shall pierce
through thy own soul also,) that the
thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</p>

<p>And there was one Anna, a prophetess,
the daughter of Phanuel, of
the tribe of Aser: she was of a great
age, and had lived with an husband
seven years; and she was a widow of
about fourscore and four years, which
departed not from the temple, but
served God with fastings and prayers
night and day. And she coming
in that instant gave thanks likewise
unto the Lord, and spake of him to
all them that looked for redemption
in Jerusalem.</p>

<small>THE WISE MEN OF THE EAST</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>NOW when Jesus was born in
Bethlehem of Judæa in the
days of Herod the king, behold,
there came wise men from the
east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is
he that is born King of the Jews?
for we have seen his star in the east,
and are come to worship him. When
Herod the king had heard these
things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem
with him. And when he had
gathered all the chief priests and
scribes of the people together, he demanded
of them where Christ should
be born. And they said unto him, In
Bethlehem of Judæa: for thus it is
written by the prophet, And thou
Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art
not the least among the princes of
Juda: for out of thee shall come a
Governor, that shall rule my people
Israel. Then Herod, when he had
privily called the wise men, enquired
of them diligently what time the star
appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem,
and said, Go and search diligently
for the young child; and when
ye have found him, bring me word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
again, that I may come and worship
him also. When they had heard the
king, they departed; and, lo, the star,
which they saw in the east, went before
them, till it came and stood over
where the young child was. When
they saw the star, they rejoiced with
exceeding great joy.</div>

</div>

<p>And when they were come into the
house, they saw the young child with
Mary his mother, and fell down, and
worshipped him: and when they had
opened their treasures, they presented
unto him gifts; gold, and
frankincense, and myrrh. And being
warned of God in a dream that they
should not return to Herod, they departed
into their own country another
way. And when they were departed,
behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth
to Joseph in a dream, saying,
Arise, and take the young child and
his mother, and flee into Egypt, and
be thou there until I bring thee word:
for Herod will seek the young child
to destroy him. When he arose, he
took the young child and his mother
by night, and departed into Egypt:
and was there until the death of Herod:
that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,
saying, Out of Egypt have I
called my son.</p>

<p>Then Herod, when he saw that he
was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding
wroth, and sent forth, and
slew all the children that were in
Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof,
from two years old and under, according
to the time which he had diligently
enquired of the wise men.
Then was fulfilled that which was
spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
In Rama was there a voice heard,
lamentation, and weeping, and great
mourning, Rachel weeping for her
children, and would not be comforted,
because they are not.</p>

<p>But when Herod was dead, behold,
an angel of the Lord appeareth in a
dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
Arise, and take the young child and
his mother, and go into the land of Israel:
for they are dead which sought
the young child's life. And he arose,
and took the young child and his mother,
and came into the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus
did reign in Judæa in the room of
his father Herod, he was afraid to
go thither: notwithstanding, being
warned of God in a dream, he turned
aside into the parts of Galilee: and
he came and dwelt in a city called
Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the prophets,
He shall be called a Nazarene.</p>

<small>CHRIST FOUND IN THE TEMPLE</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND the child grew, and waxed
strong in spirit, filled with
wisdom: and the grace of God
was upon him. Now his parents went
to Jerusalem every year at the feast
of the passover. And when he was
twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
after the custom of the feast.
And when they had fulfilled the days,
as they returned, the child Jesus tarried
behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph
and his mother knew not of it.
But they, supposing him to have been
in the company, went a day's journey;
and they sought him among
their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
when they found him not, they turned
back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.
And it came to pass, that after three
days they found him in the temple,
sitting in the midst of the doctors,
both hearing them, and asking them
questions. And all that heard him
were astonished at his understanding
and answers. And when they saw
him, they were amazed: and his mother
said unto him, Son, why hast
thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy
father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
And he said unto them, How
is it that ye sought me? wist ye not
that I must be about my Father's
business? And they understood not
the saying which he spake unto them.
And he went down with them, and
came to Nazareth, and was subject
unto them: but his mother kept all
these sayings in her heart. And Jesus
increased in wisdom and stature,
and in favour with God and man.</div>

<small>JOHN BAPTIZES JESUS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 3</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THERE was a man sent from
God, whose name was John.
The same came for a witness,
to bear witness of the Light, that all
men through him might believe. He
was not that Light, but was sent to
bear witness of that Light. That was
the true Light, which lighteth every
man that cometh into the world. He
was in the world, and the world was
made by him, and the world knew
him not. He came unto his own, and
his own received him not. But as
many as received him, to them gave
he power to become the sons of God,
even to them that believe on his
name: which were born, not of blood,
nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the
will of man, but of God. And the
Word was made flesh, and dwelt
among us, (and we beheld his glory,
the glory as of the only begotten
of the Father,) full of grace and
truth.</div>

<p>In the fifteenth year of the reign of
Tiberius Cæsar, Pontius Pilate being
governor of Judæa, and Herod being
tetrarch of Galilee, Annas and Caiaphas
being the high priests, the word
of God came unto John the son of
Zacharias in the wilderness. And he
came into all the country about Jordan,
preaching the baptism of repentance
for the remission of sins; as it
is written in the book of the words of
Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice
of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare
ye the way of the Lord, make
his paths straight. Every valley
shall be filled, and every mountain
and hill shall be brought low; and the
crooked shall be made straight, and
the rough ways shall be made smooth;
And all flesh shall see the salvation
of God. And the same John had
his raiment of camel's hair, and a
leathern girdle about his loins; and
his meat was locusts and wild honey.
Then went out to him Jerusalem, and
all Judæa, and all the region round
about Jordan, and were baptized of
him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
Then said he to the multitude that
came forth to be baptized of him,
O generation of vipers, who hath
warned you to flee from the wrath
to come? Bring forth therefore
fruits worthy of repentance, and begin
not to say within yourselves, We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
have Abraham to our father: for I
say unto you, That God is able of
these stones to raise up children unto
Abraham. And now also the axe is
laid unto the root of the trees: every
tree therefore which bringeth not
forth good fruit is hewn down, and
cast into the fire. And the people
asked him, saying, What shall we do
then? He answereth and saith unto
them, He that hath two coats, let
him impart to him that hath none;
and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.
Then came also publicans to
be baptized, and said unto him, Master,
what shall we do? And he said
unto them, Exact no more than that
which is appointed you. And the
soldiers likewise demanded of him,
saying, And what shall we do? And
he said unto them, Do violence to no
man, neither accuse any falsely; and
be content with your wages.</p>

<p>And as the people were in expectation,
and all men mused in their
hearts of John, whether he were the
Christ, or not; John answered, saying
unto them all, I indeed baptize
you with water; but one mightier
than I cometh, the latchet of whose
shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he
shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
and with fire: whose fan is in his
hand, and he will throughly purge
his floor, and will gather the wheat
into his garner; but the chaff he will
burn with fire unquenchable. And
many other things in his exhortation
preached he unto the people.</p>

<p>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee
to Jordan unto John, to be baptized
of him. But John forbad him, saying,
I have need to be baptized of
thee, and comest thou to me? And
Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer
it to be so now: for thus it becometh
us to fulfil all righteousness.
Then he suffered him. And Jesus,
when he was baptized, went up
straightway out of the water: and, lo,
the heavens were opened unto him,
and he saw the Spirit of God descending
like a dove, and lighting upon
him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying,
This is my beloved Son, in whom
I am well pleased. And Jesus himself
began to be about thirty years of
age.</p>

<div class="drop-capi2">THEN was Jesus led
up of the spirit

And when he had

every word that proceedeth out of the

<p>Then the devil taketh him up into

him, If thou be the Son of God, cast
thyself down: for it is written, He
shall give his angels charge concerning

thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Jesus said unto him, It is written
again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord

him up into an exceeding high mountain,
and sheweth him all the kingdoms
of the world, and the glory of

saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence,

<small>DISCIPLES CALLED</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">St. John 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THESE things were done in
Bethabara beyond Jordan,
where John was baptizing.
The next day John seeth Jesus coming
unto him, and saith, Behold the
Lamb of God, which taketh away the
sin of the world. This is he of whom
I said, After me cometh a man which
is preferred before me: for he was
before me. And I knew him not: but
that he should be made manifest to
Israel, therefore am I come baptizing
with water. And John bare record,
saying, I saw the Spirit descending
from heaven like a dove, and it abode
upon him. And I knew him not: but
he that sent me to baptize with water,
the same said unto me, Upon whom
thou shalt see the Spirit descending,
and remaining on him, the same is
he which baptizeth with the Holy
Ghost. And I saw, and bare record
that this is the Son of God. Again
the next day after John stood, and
two of his disciples; and looking upon
Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold
the Lamb of God! And the two disciples
heard him speak, and they followed
Jesus. Then Jesus turned,
and saw them following, and saith
unto them, What seek ye? They said
unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say,
being interpreted, Master,) where
dwellest thou? He saith unto them,
Come and see. They came and saw
where he dwelt, and abode with him
that day: for it was about the tenth
hour. One of the two which heard
John speak, and followed him, was
Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He
first findeth his own brother Simon,
and saith unto him, We have found
the Messias, which is, being interpreted,
the Christ. And he brought
him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld
him, he said, Thou art Simon
the son of Jona: thou shalt be called
Cephas, which is by interpretation,
A stone. The day following Jesus
would go forth into Galilee, and findeth
Philip, and saith unto him, Follow
me. Now Philip was of Bethsaida,
the city of Andrew and Peter.
Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith
unto him, We have found him, of
whom Moses in the law, and the prophets,
did write, Jesus of Nazareth,
the son of Joseph. And Nathanael
said unto him, Can there any good
thing come out of Nazareth? Philip
saith unto him, Come and see. Jesus
saw Nathanael coming to him, and
saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed,
in whom is no guile! Nathanael
saith unto him, Whence knowest
thou me? Jesus answered and
said unto him, Before that Philip
called thee, when thou wast under
the fig tree, I saw thee. Nathanael
answered and saith unto him, Rabbi,
thou art the Son of God; thou art
the King of Israel. Jesus answered
and said unto him, Because I said
unto thee, I saw thee under the fig
tree, believest thou? thou shalt see
greater things than these. And he
saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Hereafter ye shall see
heaven open, and the angels of God

<small>THE FIRST MIRACLE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 2</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND the third day there was a
marriage in Cana of Galilee;
and the mother of Jesus was
there: and both Jesus was called,
and his disciples, to the marriage.</div>

<p>And when they wanted wine, the
mother of Jesus saith unto him, They
have no wine. Jesus saith unto her,
Woman, what have I to do with thee?
mine hour is not yet come. His mother
saith unto the servants, Whatsoever
he saith unto you, do it.</p>

<p>And there were set there six waterpots
of stone, after the manner of the
purifying of the Jews, containing two
or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith
unto them, Fill the waterpots with
water. And they filled them up to
the brim. And he saith unto them,
Draw out now, and bear unto the
governor of the feast. And they
bare it.</p>

<p>When the ruler of the feast had
tasted the water that was made wine,
and knew not whence it was: (but
the servants which drew the water
knew;) the governor of the feast
called the bridegroom, and saith unto
him, Every man at the beginning
doth set forth good wine; and when
men have well drunk, then that which
is worse: but thou hast kept the good
wine until now.</p>

<p>This beginning of miracles did
Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested
forth his glory; and his disciples
believed on him.</p>

<p>After this he went down to Capernaum,
he, and his mother, and his
brethren, and his disciples: and they
continued there not many days. And
the Jews' passover was at hand, and
Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and
found in the temple those that sold
oxen and sheep and doves, and the
changers of money sitting: and when
he had made a scourge of small cords,
he drove them all out of the temple,
and the sheep, and the oxen; and
poured out the changers' money, and
overthrew the tables; and said unto
them that sold doves, Take these
things hence; make not my Father's
house an house of merchandise. And
his disciples remembered that it was
written, The zeal of thine house hath
eaten me up. Then answered the
Jews and said unto him, What sign
shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou
doest these things? Jesus answered
and said unto them, Destroy this temple,
and in three days I will raise it
up. Then said the Jews, Forty and
six years was this temple in building,
and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
But he spake of the temple of his
body. When therefore he was risen
from the dead, his disciples remembered
that he had said this unto
them; and they believed the scripture,
and the word which Jesus had
said.</p>

<p>Now when he was in Jerusalem at
the passover, in the feast day, many
believed in his name, when they
saw the miracles which he did. But
Jesus did not commit himself unto
them, because he knew all men, and
needed not that any should testify
of man: for he knew what was in
man.</p>

<small>NICODEMUS COMES TO JESUS
BY NIGHT</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 3</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THERE was a man of the Pharisees,
named Nicodemus, a
ruler of the Jews: the same
came to Jesus by night, and said unto
him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a
teacher come from God: for no man
can do these miracles that thou doest,
except God be with him. Jesus answered
and said unto him, Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
of God. Nicodemus saith unto
him, How can a man be born when he
is old? can he enter the second time
into his mother's womb, and be born?
Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say
unto thee, Except a man be born of
water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God. That
which is born of the flesh is flesh; and
that which is born of the Spirit is
spirit. Marvel not that I said unto
thee, Ye must be born again. The
wind bloweth where it listeth, and
thou hearest the sound thereof, but
canst not tell whence it cometh, and
whither it goeth: so is every one that
is born of the Spirit. Nicodemus answered
and said unto him, How can
these things be? Jesus answered
and said unto him, Art thou a master
of Israel, and knowest not these
things? Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, We speak that we do know, and
testify that we have seen; and ye receive
not our witness. If I have told
you earthly things, and ye believe
not, how shall ye believe, if I tell
you of heavenly things? And no
man hath ascended up to heaven,
but he that came down from heaven,
even the Son of man which is
in heaven. And as Moses lifted up
the serpent in the wilderness, even
so must the Son of man be lifted
up: that whosoever believeth in
him should not perish, but have
eternal life. For God so loved the
world, that he gave his only begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth
in him should not perish, but have
everlasting life. For God sent not
his Son into the world to condemn
the world; but that the world
through him might be saved. He
that believeth on him is not condemned:
but he that believeth not
is condemned already, because he
hath not believed in the name of the
only begotten Son of God. And
this is the condemnation, that light
is come into the world, and men
loved darkness rather than light,
because their deeds were evil. For
every one that doeth evil hateth the
light, neither cometh to the light, lest
his deeds should be reproved. But
he that doeth truth cometh to the
light, that his deeds may be made
manifest, that they are wrought in
God.</div>

<p>After these things came Jesus and
his disciples into the land of Judæa;
and there he tarried with them,
and baptized. And John also was
baptizing in Ænon near to Salim,
because there was much water there:
and they came, and were baptized.
For John was not yet cast into
prison.</p>

<small>THE WOMAN OF SAMARIA</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 4</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>WHEN therefore the Lord
knew how the Pharisees
had heard that Jesus made
and baptized more disciples than
John, (though Jesus himself baptized
not, but his disciples,) he left Judæa,
and departed again into Galilee. And
he must needs go through Samaria.
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria,
which is called Sychar, near to the
parcel of ground that Jacob gave to
his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well
was there. Jesus therefore, being
wearied with his journey, sat thus on
the well: and it was about the sixth
hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria
to draw water: Jesus saith unto
her, Give me to drink. (For his disciples
were gone away unto the city
to buy meat.)</div>

<p>Then saith the woman of Samaria
unto him, How is it that thou, being
a Jew, askest drink of me, which am
a woman of Samaria? for the Jews
have no dealings with the Samaritans.
Jesus answered and said unto
her, If thou knewest the gift of God,
and who it is that saith to thee, Give
me to drink; thou wouldest have
asked of him, and he would have
given thee living water.</p>

<p>The woman saith unto him, Sir,
thou hast nothing to draw with, and
the well is deep: from whence then
hast thou that living water? Art thou
greater than our father Jacob, which
gave us the well, and drank thereof
himself, and his children, and his cattle?
Jesus answered and said unto
her, Whosoever drinketh of this water
shall thirst again: but whosoever
drinketh of the water that I shall give
him shall never thirst; but the water
that I shall give him shall be in him
a well of water springing up into
everlasting life.</p>

<p>The woman saith unto him, Sir,
give me this water, that I thirst not,
neither come hither to draw. Jesus
saith unto her, Go, call thy husband,
and come hither. The woman answered
and said, I have no husband.
Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well
said, I have no husband: for thou hast
had five husbands; and he whom thou
now hast is not thy husband: in that
saidst thou truly. The woman saith
unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou
art a prophet. Our fathers worshipped
in this mountain; and ye say,
that in Jerusalem is the place where
men ought to worship. Jesus saith
unto her, Woman, believe me, the
hour cometh, when ye shall neither
in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,
worship the Father. Ye worship
ye know not what: we know what we
worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
But the hour cometh, and now is,
when the true worshippers shall worship
the Father in spirit and in truth:
for the Father seeketh such to worship
him. God is a Spirit: and they
that worship him must worship him
in spirit and in truth. The woman
saith unto him, I know that Messias
cometh, which is called Christ: when
he is come, he will tell us all things.
Jesus saith unto her, I that speak
unto thee am he.</p>

<p>And upon this came his disciples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
and marvelled that he talked with the
woman: yet no man said, What seekest
thou? or, Why talkest thou with
her? The woman then left her water-pot,
and went her way into the city,
and saith to the men, Come, see a
man, which told me all things that
ever I did: is not this the Christ?
Then they went out of the city, and
came unto him.</p>

<p>In the mean while his disciples
prayed him, saying, Master, eat. But
he said unto them, I have meat to
eat that ye know not of. Therefore
said the disciples one to another,
Hath any man brought him ought to
eat? Jesus saith unto them, My meat
is to do the will of him that sent me,
and to finish his work. Say not ye,
There are yet four months, and then
cometh harvest? behold, I say unto
you, Lift up your eyes, and look on
the fields; for they are white already
to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth
wages, and gathereth fruit
unto life eternal: that both he that
soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice
together. And herein is that
saying true, One soweth, and another
reapeth. I sent you to reap that
whereon ye bestowed no labour: other
men laboured, and ye are entered
into their labours.</p>

<p>And many of the Samaritans of
that city believed on him for the saying
of the woman, which testified, He
told me all that ever I did. So when
the Samaritans were come unto him,
they besought him that he would
tarry with them: and he abode there
two days. And many more believed
because of his own word; and said
unto the woman, Now we believe, not
because of thy saying: for we have
heard him ourselves, and know that
this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour
of the world.</p>

that John was cast into prison,
he departed into Galilee.
For Jesus himself testified, that
a prophet hath no honour in his own
country. Then when he was come
into Galilee, the Galilæans received
him, having seen all the things that
he did at Jerusalem at the feast:
for they also went unto the feast.
So Jesus came again into Cana of
Galilee, where he made the water
wine.</div>

<p>And there was a certain nobleman,
whose son was sick at Capernaum.
When he heard that Jesus was come
out of Judæa into Galilee, he went
unto him, and besought him that he
would come down, and heal his son:
for he was at the point of death.</p>

<p>Then said Jesus unto him, Except
ye see signs and wonders, ye will not
believe. The nobleman saith unto
him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way;
thy son liveth. And the man believed
the word that Jesus had spoken unto
him, and he went his way.</p>

<p>And as he was now going down, his
servants met him, and told him, saying,
Thy son liveth. Then enquired
he of them the hour when he began
to amend. And they said unto him,
Yesterday at the seventh hour the
fever left him. So the father knew
that it was at the same hour, in the
which Jesus said unto him, Thy son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
liveth: and himself believed, and his
whole house. This is again the second
miracle that Jesus did, when he
was come out of Judæa into Galilee.</p>

<small>JESUS PREACHES AT NAZARETH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 4</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Jesus came to Nazareth,
where he had been brought
up: and, as his custom was,
he went into the synagogue on the
sabbath day, and stood up for to read.
And there was delivered unto him
the book of the prophet Esaias. And
when he had opened the book, he
found the place where it was written,
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because he hath anointed me to
preach the gospel to the poor; he hath
sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to
preach deliverance to the captives,
and recovering of sight to the blind,
to set at liberty them that are bruised,
to preach the acceptable year of the
Lord. And he closed the book, and
he gave it again to the minister, and
sat down. And the eyes of all them
that were in the synagogue were fastened
on him. And he began to say
unto them, This day is this scripture
fulfilled in your ears.</div>

<p>And all bare him witness, and wondered
at the gracious words which
proceeded out of his mouth. And
they said, Is not this Joseph's son?
And he said unto them, Ye will surely
say unto me this proverb, Physician,
heal thyself: whatsoever we have
heard done in Capernaum, do also
here in thy country. And he said,
Verily I say unto you, No prophet is
accepted in his own country. But I
tell you of a truth, many widows
were in Israel in the days of Elias,
when the heaven was shut up three
years and six months, when great
famine was throughout all the land;
but unto none of them was Elias sent,
save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon,
unto a woman that was a widow. And
many lepers were in Israel in the time
of Eliseus the prophet; and none of
them was cleansed, saving Naaman
the Syrian. And all they in the synagogue,
when they heard these things,
were filled with wrath, and rose up,
and thrust him out of the city, and led
him unto the brow of the hill whereon
their city was built, that they
might cast him down headlong. But
he passing through the midst of them
went his way.</p>

<small>THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT
OF FISHES</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, that, as the
people pressed upon him to
hear the word of God, he
stood by the lake of Gennesaret, and
saw two ships standing by the lake:
but the fishermen were gone out of
them, and were washing their nets.</div>

<p>And he entered into one of the
ships, which was Simon's, and prayed
him that he would thrust out a little
from the land. And he sat down, and
taught the people out of the ship.</p>

<p>Now when he had left speaking, he
said unto Simon, Launch out into the
deep, and let down your nets for a
draught. And Simon answering said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
unto him, Master, we have toiled all
the night, and have taken nothing:
nevertheless at thy word I will let
down the net. And when they had
this done, they inclosed a great multitude
of fishes: and their net brake.
And they beckoned unto their partners,
which were in the other ship,
that they should come and help them.</p>

<p>And they came, and filled both the
ships, so that they began to sink.
When Simon Peter saw it, he fell
down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart
from me; for I am a sinful man, O
Lord. For he was astonished, and all
that were with him, at the draught of
the fishes which they had taken: and
so was also James, and John, the sons
of Zebedee, which were partners with
Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon,
Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt
catch men. And when they had
brought their ships to land, they forsook
all, and followed him.</p>

<small>JESUS HEALS THE SICK</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Mark 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND they went into Capernaum;
and straightway on the sabbath
day he entered into the
synagogue, and taught. And they
were astonished at his doctrine: for
he taught them as one that had authority,
and not as the scribes. And
there was in their synagogue a man
with an unclean spirit; and he cried
out, saying, Let us alone; what have
we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?
art thou come to destroy us?
I know thee who thou art, the Holy
One of God. And Jesus rebuked him,
saying, Hold thy peace, and come out
of him. And when the unclean spirit
had torn him, and cried with a loud
voice, he came out of him. And they
were all amazed, insomuch that they
questioned among themselves, saying,
What thing is this? what new
doctrine is this? for with authority
commandeth he even the unclean
spirits, and they do obey him. And
immediately his fame spread abroad
throughout all the region round about
Galilee.</div>

<p>And forthwith, when they were
come out of the synagogue, they entered
into the house of Simon and
Andrew, with James and John. But
Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a
fever, and anon they tell him of her.
And he came and took her by the
hand, and lifted her up; and immediately
the fever left her, and she
ministered unto them. And at even,
when the sun did set, they brought
unto him all that were diseased, and
them that were possessed with devils.
And all the city was gathered together
at the door. And he healed
many that were sick of divers diseases,
and cast out many devils; and
suffered not the devils to speak, because
they knew him.</p>

<p>And in the morning, rising up a
great while before day, he went out,
and departed into a solitary place,
and there prayed. And Simon and
they that were with him followed after
him. And when they had found
him, they said unto him, All men seek
for thee. And he said unto them, Let
us go into the next towns, that I may
preach there also: for therefore came
I forth. And he preached in their
synagogues throughout all Galilee,
and cast out devils. And there came
a leper to him, beseeching him, and
kneeling down to him, and saying
unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
make me clean. And Jesus, moved
with compassion, put forth his hand,
and touched him, and saith unto him,
I will; be thou clean. And as soon as
he had spoken, immediately the leprosy
departed from him, and he was
cleansed. And he straitly charged
him, and forthwith sent him away;
and saith unto him, See thou say nothing
to any man: but go thy way, shew
thyself to the priest, and offer for thy
cleansing those things which Moses
commanded, for a testimony unto
them. But he went out, and began to
publish it much, and to blaze abroad
the matter, insomuch that Jesus could
no more openly enter into the city,
but was without in desert places: and
they came to him from every quarter.</p>

<p>And again he entered into Capernaum
after some days; and it was
noised that he was in the house. And
straightway many were gathered together,
insomuch that there was no
room to receive them, no, not so much
as about the door: and he preached
the word unto them. And they come
unto him, bringing one sick of the
palsy, which was borne of four. And
when they could not come nigh unto
him for the press, they uncovered the
roof where he was: and when they
had broken it up, they let down the
bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said
unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy
sins be forgiven thee. But there
were certain of the scribes sitting
there, and reasoning in their hearts,
Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies?
who can forgive sins but
God only? And immediately when
Jesus perceived in his spirit that they
so reasoned within themselves, he
said unto them, Why reason ye these
things in your hearts? Whether is
it easier to say to the sick of the palsy,
Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say,
Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?
But that ye may know that the Son
of man hath power on earth to forgive
sins, (he saith to the sick of the
palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and
take up thy bed, and go thy way into
thine house. And immediately he
arose, took up the bed, and went forth
before them all; insomuch that they
were all amazed, and glorified God,
saying, We never saw it on this
fashion.</p>

<p>And he went forth again by the
sea side; and all the multitude resorted
unto him, and he taught them.
And as he passed by, he saw Levi the
son of Alphæus sitting at the receipt
of custom, and said unto him, Follow
me. And he arose and followed him.
And it came to pass, that, as Jesus
sat at meat in his house, many publicans
and sinners sat also together
with Jesus and his disciples: for there
were many, and they followed him.
And when the scribes and Pharisees
saw him eat with publicans and sinners,
they said unto his disciples,
How is it that he eateth and drinketh
with publicans and sinners? When
Jesus heard it, he saith unto them,
They that are whole have no need of
the physician, but they that are sick:
I came not to call the righteous, but
sinners to repentance.</p>

<small>THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 5</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND seeing the multitudes, he
went up into a mountain: and
when he was set, his disciples
came unto him: and he opened his
mouth, and taught them, saying,</div>

<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for
their's is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>Blessed are they that mourn: for
they shall be comforted.</p>

<p>Blessed are the meek: for they
shall inherit the earth.</p>

<p>Blessed are they which do hunger
and thirst after righteousness: for
they shall be filled.</p>

<p>Blessed are the merciful: for they
shall obtain mercy.</p>


<p>Blessed are the pure in heart: for
they shall see God.</p>

<p>Blessed are the peacemakers: for
they shall be called the children of
God.</p>

<p>Blessed are they which are persecuted
for righteousness' sake: for
their's is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile
you, and persecute you, and shall say
all manner of evil against you falsely,
for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding
glad: for great is your reward in
heaven: for so persecuted they the
prophets which were before you.</p>

<p>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if
the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
shall it be salted? it is thenceforth
good for nothing, but to be cast
out, and to be trodden under foot of
men. Ye are the light of the world.
A city that is set on an hill cannot be
hid. Neither do men light a candle,
and put it under a bushel, but on a
candlestick; and it giveth light unto
all that are in the house. Let your
light so shine before men, that they
may see your good works, and glorify
your Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p>Think not that I am come to destroy
the law, or the prophets: I am
not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For
verily I say unto you, Till heaven and
earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall
in no wise pass from the law, till all
be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore
shall break one of these least commandments,
and shall teach men so,
he shall be called the least in the kingdom
of heaven: but whosoever shall
do and teach them, the same shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I say unto you, That except
your righteousness shall exceed the
righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
ye shall in no case enter into
the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>Ye have heard that it was said by
them of old time, Thou shalt not kill;
and whosoever shall kill shall be in
danger of the judgment: but I say
unto you, That whosoever is angry
with his brother without a cause shall
be in danger of the judgment: and
whosoever shall say to his brother,
Raca, shall be in danger of the council:
but whosoever shall say, Thou
fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
Therefore if thou bring thy gift to
the altar, and there rememberest that
thy brother hath ought against thee;
leave there thy gift before the altar,
and go thy way; first be reconciled
to thy brother, and then come and offer
thy gift. Agree with thine adversary
quickly, whiles thou art in the
way with him; lest at any time the
adversary deliver thee to the judge,
and the judge deliver thee to the officer,
and thou be cast into prison.
Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt
by no means come out thence, till thou
hast paid the uttermost farthing.</p>

<p>Again, ye have heard that it hath
been said by them of old time, Thou
shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt
perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
but I say unto you, Swear not at all;
neither by heaven; for it is God's
throne: nor by the earth; for it is
his footstool: neither by Jerusalem;
for it is the city of the great King.
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head,
because thou canst not make one hair
white or black. But let your communication
be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for
whatsoever is more than these cometh
of evil.</p>

<p>Ye have heard that it hath been
said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth
for a tooth: but I say unto you, That
ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall
smite thee on thy right cheek, turn
to him the other also. And if any
man will sue thee at the law, and take
away thy coat, let him have thy cloke
also. And whosoever shall compel
thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
Give to him that asketh thee, and
from him that would borrow of thee
turn not thou away.</p>

<p>Ye have heard that it hath been
said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour,
and hate thine enemy. But I say
unto you, Love your enemies, bless
them that curse you, do good to them
that hate you, and pray for them
which despitefully use you, and persecute
you; that ye may be the children
of your Father which is in heaven:
for he maketh his sun to rise on
the evil and on the good, and sendeth
rain on the just and on the unjust.
For if ye love them which love you,
what reward have ye? do not even
the publicans the same? And if ye
salute your brethren only, what do
ye more than others? do not even the
publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect,
even as your Father which is in
heaven is perfect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 6</div>

<p>Take heed that ye do not your alms
before men, to be seen of them: otherwise
ye have no reward of your Father
which is in heaven. Therefore
when thou doest thine alms, do not
sound a trumpet before thee, as the
hypocrites do in the synagogues and
in the streets, that they may have
glory of men. Verily I say unto you,
They have their reward. But when
thou doest alms, let not thy left hand
know what thy right hand doeth: that
thine alms may be in secret: and thy
Father which seeth in secret himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
shall reward thee openly. And when
thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the
hypocrites are: for they love to pray
standing in the synagogues and in the
corners of the streets, that they may
be seen of men. Verily I say unto
you, They have their reward. But
thou, when thou prayest, enter into
thy closet, and when thou hast shut
thy door, pray to thy Father which is
in secret; and thy Father which seeth
in secret shall reward thee openly.
But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions,
as the heathen do: for they
think that they shall be heard for
their much speaking. Be not ye
therefore like unto them: for your
Father knoweth what things ye have
need of, before ye ask him. After
this manner therefore pray ye:</p>

<p>Our Father which art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done in earth,
as it is in heaven. Give us this day
our daily bread. And forgive us our
debts, as we forgive our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil: For thine is the
kingdom, and the power, and the
glory, for ever. Amen.</p>

<p>For if ye forgive men their trespasses,
your heavenly Father will also
forgive you: but if ye forgive not
men their trespasses, neither will
your Father forgive your trespasses.</p>

<p>Lay not up for yourselves treasures
upon earth, where moth and rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves break
through and steal: but lay up for
yourselves treasures in heaven, where
neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,
and where thieves do not break
through nor steal: for where your
treasure is, there will your heart be
also. The light of the body is the
eye: if therefore thine eye be single,
thy whole body shall be full of light.
But if thine eye be evil, thy whole
body shall be full of darkness. If
therefore the light that is in thee be
darkness, how great is that darkness!</p>

<p>No man can serve two masters: for
either he will hate the one, and love
the other; or else he will hold to the
one, and despise the other. Ye cannot
serve God and mammon. Therefore
I say unto you, Take no thought
for your life, what ye shall eat, or
what ye shall drink; nor yet for your
body, what ye shall put on. Is not
the life more than meat, and the body
than raiment? Behold the fowls of
the air: for they sow not, neither do
they reap, nor gather into barns; yet
your heavenly Father feedeth them.
Are ye not much better than they?
Which of you by taking thought can
add one cubit unto his stature? And
why take ye thought for raiment?
Consider the lilies of the field, how
they grow; they toil not, neither do
they spin: and yet I say unto you,
That even Solomon in all his glory
was not arrayed like one of these.
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass
of the field, which to day is, and to
morrow is cast into the oven, shall
he not much more clothe you, O ye
of little faith? Therefore take no
thought, saying, What shall we eat?
or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal
shall we be clothed? (for after
all these things do the Gentiles
seek:) for your heavenly Father
knoweth that ye have need of all these
things. But seek ye first the kingdom
of God, and his righteousness; and
all these things shall be added unto
you. Take therefore no thought for
the morrow: for the morrow shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
take thought for the things of itself.
Sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 7</div>

<p>Judge not, that ye be not judged.
For with what judgment ye judge,
ye shall be judged: and with what
measure ye mete, it shall be measured
to you again. And why beholdest
thou the mote that is in thy brother's
eye, but considerest not the beam that
is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou
say to thy brother, Let me pull out the
mote out of thine eye; and, behold,
a beam is in thine own eye? Thou
hypocrite, first cast out the beam out
of thine own eye; and then shalt thou
see clearly to cast out the mote out of
thy brother's eye.</p>

<p>Give not that which is holy unto
the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
before swine, lest they trample them
under their feet, and turn again and
rend you.</p>

<p>Ask, and it shall be given you;
seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
shall be opened unto you: for every
one that asketh receiveth; and he that
seeketh findeth; and to him that
knocketh it shall be opened. Or what
man is there of you, whom if his son
ask bread, will he give him a stone?
Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a
serpent? If ye then, being evil, know
how to give good gifts unto your children,
how much more shall your Father
which is in heaven give good
things to them that ask him? Therefore
all things whatsoever ye would
that men should do to you, do ye even
so to them: for this is the law and the
prophets.</p>

<p>Enter ye in at the strait gate: for
wide is the gate, and broad is the
way, that leadeth to destruction, and
many there be which go in thereat:
because strait is the gate, and narrow
is the way, which leadeth unto life,
and few there be that find it.</p>

<p>Beware of false prophets, which
come to you in sheep's clothing, but
inwardly they are ravening wolves.
Ye shall know them by their fruits.
Do men gather grapes of thorns, or
figs of thistles? Even so every good
tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a
corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
A good tree cannot bring forth evil
fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring
forth good fruit. Every tree that
bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
down, and cast into the fire.</p>

<p>Wherefore by their fruits ye shall
know them. Not every one that saith
unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven; but he that
doeth the will of my Father which is
in heaven. Many will say to me in
that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
prophesied in thy name? and in thy
name have cast out devils? and in thy
name done many wonderful works?
And then will I profess unto them, I
never knew you: depart from me, ye
that work iniquity.</p>

<p>Therefore whosoever heareth these
sayings of mine, and doeth them, I
will liken him unto a wise man, which
built his house upon a rock: and the
rain descended, and the floods came,
and the winds blew, and beat upon
that house; and it fell not: for it was
founded upon a rock. And every one
that heareth these sayings of mine,
and doeth them not, shall be likened
unto a foolish man, which built his
house upon the sand: and the rain
descended, and the floods came, and
the winds blew, and beat upon that
house; and it fell: and great was the
fall of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Jesus
had ended these sayings, the people
were astonished at his doctrine: for
he taught them as one having authority,
and not as the scribes.</p>

<small>THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Mark 5</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND when Jesus was passed over
again by ship unto the other
side, much people gathered
unto him: and he was nigh unto the
sea. And, behold, there cometh one
of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus
by name; and when he saw him, he
fell at his feet, and besought him
greatly, saying, My little daughter
lieth at the point of death: I pray
thee, come and lay thy hands on her,
that she may be healed; and she shall
live. And Jesus went with him; and
much people followed him, and
thronged him. And a certain woman,
which had an issue of blood twelve
years, and had suffered many things
of many physicians, and had spent
all that she had, and was nothing bettered,
but rather grew worse, when
she had heard of Jesus, came in the
press behind, and touched his garment.
For she said, If I may touch
but his clothes, I shall be whole. And
straightway the fountain of her blood
was dried up; and she felt in her
body that she was healed of that
plague.</div>

<p>And Jesus, immediately knowing
in himself that virtue had gone out
of him, turned him about in the press,
and said, Who touched my clothes?
And his disciples said unto him, Thou
seest the multitude thronging thee,
and sayest thou, Who touched me?
And he looked round about to see
her that had done this thing.</p>

<p>But the woman fearing and trembling,
knowing what was done in her,
came and fell down before him, and
told him all the truth. And he said
unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath
made thee whole; go in peace, and be
whole of thy plague.</p>

<p>While he yet spake, there came
from the ruler of the synagogue's
house certain which said, Thy daughter
is dead: why troublest thou the
Master any further? As soon as Jesus
heard the word that was spoken,
he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue,
Be not afraid, only believe.
And he suffered no man to follow
him, save Peter, and James, and John
the brother of James. And he cometh
to the house of the ruler of the
synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and
them that wept and wailed greatly.
And when he was come in, he saith
unto them, Why make ye this ado,
and weep? the damsel is not dead, but
sleepeth. And they laughed him to
scorn. But when he had put them all
out, he taketh the father and the mother
of the damsel, and them that
were with him, and entereth in where
the damsel was lying. And he took
the damsel by the hand, and said unto
her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted,
Damsel, I say unto thee,
arise. And straightway the damsel
arose, and walked; for she was of the
age of twelve years. And they were
astonished with a great astonishment.
And he charged them straitly that no
man should know it; and commanded
that something should be given her
to eat.</p>

<small>THE POOL OF BETHESDA</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 5</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AFTER this there was a feast of
the Jews; and Jesus went up
to Jerusalem.</div>

<p>Now there is at Jerusalem by the
sheep market a pool, which is called
in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having
five porches. In these lay a great
multitude of impotent folk, of blind,
halt, withered, waiting for the moving
of the water. For an angel went
down at a certain season into the pool,
and troubled the water: whosoever
then first after the troubling of the
water stepped in was made whole of
whatsoever disease he had.</p>

<p>And a certain man was there, which
had an infirmity thirty and eight
years. When Jesus saw him lie, and
knew that he had been now a long
time in that case, he saith unto him,
Wilt thou be made whole? The impotent
man answered him, Sir, I have
no man, when the water is troubled,
to put me into the pool: but while I
am coming, another steppeth down
before me. Jesus saith unto him,
Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
And immediately the man was made
whole, and took up his bed, and
walked: and on the same day was the
sabbath.</p>

<p>The Jews therefore said unto him
that was cured, It is the sabbath day:
it is not lawful for thee to carry thy
bed. He answered them, He that
made me whole, the same said unto
me, Take up thy bed, and walk. Then
asked they him, What man is that
which said unto thee, Take up thy
bed, and walk? And he that was
healed wist not who it was: for Jesus
had conveyed himself away, a multitude
being in that place.</p>

<p>Afterward Jesus findeth him in
the temple, and said unto him, Behold,
thou art made whole: sin no
more, lest a worse thing come unto
thee. The man departed, and told the
Jews that it was Jesus, which had
made him whole.</p>

<p>And therefore did the Jews persecute
Jesus, and sought to slay him,
because he had done these things on
the sabbath day.</p>

<p>But Jesus answered them, My Father
worketh hitherto, and I work.
Therefore the Jews sought the more
to kill him, because he not only had
broken the sabbath, but said also that
God was his Father, making himself
equal with God.</p>

<p>Then answered Jesus and said
unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto
you, The Son can do nothing of himself,
but what he seeth the Father do:
for what things soever he doeth, these
also doeth the Son likewise. For the
Father loveth the Son, and sheweth
him all things that himself doeth: and
he will shew him greater works than
these, that ye may marvel. For as
the Father raiseth up the dead, and
quickeneth them; even so the Son
quickeneth whom he will. For the
Father judgeth no man, but hath committed
all judgment unto the Son:
that all men should honour the Son,
even as they honour the Father. He
that honoureth not the Son honoureth
not the Father which hath sent
him. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
He that heareth my word, and believeth
on him that sent me, hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
everlasting life, and shall not come
into condemnation; but is passed
from death unto life. Verily, verily,
I say unto you, The hour is coming,
and now is, when the dead shall hear
the voice of the Son of God: and they
that hear shall live. For as the Father
hath life in himself; so hath he
given to the Son to have life in himself;
and hath given him authority to
execute judgment also, because he is
the Son of man. Marvel not at this:
for the hour is coming, in the which
all that are in the graves shall hear
his voice, and shall come forth; they
that have done good, unto the resurrection
of life; and they that have
done evil, unto the resurrection of
damnation.</p>

<p>I can of mine own self do nothing:
as I hear, I judge: and my judgment
is just; because I seek not mine own
will, but the will of the Father which
hath sent me. If I bear witness of
myself, my witness is not true.
There is another that beareth witness
of me; and I know that the witness
which he witnesseth of me is true.
Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness
unto the truth. But I receive
not testimony from man: but these
things I say, that ye might be saved.
He was a burning and a shining light:
and ye were willing for a season
to rejoice in his light. But I have
greater witness than that of John: for
the works which the Father hath
given me to finish, the same works
that I do, bear witness of me, that
the Father hath sent me. And the
Father himself, which hath sent
me, hath borne witness of me. Ye
have neither heard his voice at any
time, nor seen his shape. And ye
have not his word abiding in you:
for whom he hath sent, him ye believe
not.</p>

<p>Search the scriptures; for in them
ye think ye have eternal life: and
they are they which testify of me.
And ye will not come to me, that ye
might have life. I receive not honour
from men. But I know you, that ye
have not the love of God in you. I
am come in my Father's name, and
ye receive me not: if another shall
come in his own name, him ye will
receive. How can ye believe, which
receive honour one of another, and
seek not the honour that cometh from
God only? Do not think that I will
accuse you to the Father: there is one
that accuseth you, even Moses, in
whom ye trust. For had ye believed
Moses, ye would have believed me:
for he wrote of me. But if ye believe
not his writings, how shall ye believe
my words?</p>

<small>JESUS HEALS ON THE SABBATH
DAY</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 12</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AT that time Jesus went on the
sabbath day through the corn;
and his disciples were an hungred,
and began to pluck the ears of
corn, and to eat. But when the Pharisees
saw it, they said unto him, Behold,
thy disciples do that which is
not lawful to do upon the sabbath
day. But he said unto them, Have ye
not read what David did, when he
was an hungred, and they that were
with him; how he entered into the
house of God, and did eat the shewbread,
which was not lawful for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
to eat, neither for them which were
with him, but only for the priests?
Or have ye not read in the law, how
that on the sabbath days the priests
in the temple profane the sabbath,
and are blameless? But I say unto
you, That in this place is one greater
than the temple. But if ye had
known what this meaneth, I will have
mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not
have condemned the guiltless. For
the Son of man is Lord even of the
sabbath day.</div>

<p>And when he was departed thence,
he went into their synagogue: and,
behold, there was a man which had
his hand withered. And they asked
him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on
the sabbath days? that they might
accuse him. And he said unto them,
What man shall there be among you,
that shall have one sheep, and if it
fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will
he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?
How much then is a man better than
a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to
do well on the sabbath days. Then
saith he to the man, Stretch forth
thine hand. And he stretched it
forth; and it was restored whole,
like as the other. Then the Pharisees
went out, and held a council
against him, how they might destroy
him. But when Jesus knew it, he
withdrew himself from thence: and
great multitudes followed him, and
he healed them all; and charged
them that they should not make him
known: that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by Esaias the prophet,
saying, Behold my servant,
whom I have chosen; my beloved, in
whom my soul is well pleased: I will
put my spirit upon him, and he shall
shew judgment to the Gentiles. He
shall not strive, nor cry; neither
shall any man hear his voice in the
streets. A bruised reed shall he not
break, and smoking flax shall he not
quench, till he send forth judgment
unto victory. And in his name shall
the Gentiles trust. While he yet
talked to the people, behold, his mother
and his brethren stood without,
desiring to speak with him. Then
one said unto him, Behold, thy mother
and thy brethren stand without,
desiring to speak with thee. But he
answered and said unto him that told
him, Who is my mother? and who are
my brethren? And he stretched
forth his hand toward his disciples,
and said, Behold my mother and my
brethren! For whosoever shall do
the will of my Father which is in
heaven, the same is my brother, and
sister, and mother.</p>

<small>THE CENTURION'S SERVANT AND
THE WIDOW'S SON</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 7</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW when he had ended all
his sayings in the audience
of the people, he entered
into Capernaum. And a certain centurion's
servant, who was dear unto
him, was sick, and ready to die. And
when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto
him the elders of the Jews, beseeching
him that he would come and heal
his servant. And when they came to
Jesus, they besought him instantly,
saying that he was worthy for whom
he should do this: for he loveth our
nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.
Then Jesus went with them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
And when he was now not far from
the house, the centurion sent friends
to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble
not thyself: for I am not worthy that
thou shouldest enter under my roof:
wherefore neither thought I myself
worthy to come unto thee: but say in
a word, and my servant shall be
healed. For I also am a man set under
authority, having under me soldiers,
and I say unto one, Go, and he
goeth; and to another, Come, and he
cometh; and to my servant, Do this,
and he doeth it. When Jesus heard
these things, he marvelled at him, and
turned him about, and said unto the
people that followed him, I say unto
you, I have not found so great faith,
no, not in Israel. And they that were
sent, returning to the house, found the
servant whole that had been sick.</div>

<p>And it came to pass the day after,
that he went into a city called Nain;
and many of his disciples went with
him, and much people. Now when
he came nigh to the gate of the city,
behold, there was a dead man carried
out, the only son of his mother, and
she was a widow: and much people
of the city was with her. And when
the Lord saw her, he had compassion
on her, and said unto her, Weep not.
And he came and touched the bier:
and they that bare him stood still.
And he said, Young man, I say unto
thee, Arise. And he that was dead
sat up, and began to speak. And he
delivered him to his mother. And
there came a fear on all: and they
glorified God, saying, A great prophet
is risen up among us; God hath
visited his people. And this rumour
of him went forth throughout all Judæa,
and throughout all the region
round about.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 11</div>

<p>Now when John had heard in the
prison the works of Christ, he sent
two of his disciples, and said unto
him, Art thou he that should come, or
do we look for another? Jesus answered
and said unto them, Go and
shew John again those things which
ye do hear and see: the blind receive
their sight, and the lame walk, the
lepers are cleansed, and the deaf
hear, the dead are raised up, and the
poor have the gospel preached to
them. And blessed is he, whosoever
shall not be offended in me.</p>

<p>And as they departed, Jesus began
to say unto the multitudes concerning
John, What went ye out into the wilderness
to see? A reed shaken with
the wind? But what went ye out for
to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?
behold, they that wear soft
clothing are in kings' houses. But
what went ye out for to see? A prophet?
yea, I say unto you, and more
than a prophet. For this is he, of
whom it is written, Behold, I send my
messenger before thy face, which
shall prepare thy way before thee.
Verily I say unto you, Among them
that are born of women there hath
not risen a greater than John the
Baptist: notwithstanding he that is
least in the kingdom of heaven is
greater than he. And from the days
of John the Baptist until now the
kingdom of heaven suffereth violence,
and the violent take it by force.
For all the prophets and the law prophesied
until John. And if ye will
receive it, this is Elias, which was
for to come. He that hath ears to
hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>But whereunto shall I liken this
generation? It is like unto children
sitting in the markets, and calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
unto their fellows, and saying, We
have piped unto you, and ye have not
danced; we have mourned unto you,
and ye have not lamented. For John
came neither eating nor drinking, and
they say, He hath a devil. The Son
of man came eating and drinking, and
they say, Behold a man gluttonous,
and a winebibber, a friend of publicans
and sinners. But wisdom is justified
of her children.</p>

<p>Then began he to upbraid the cities
wherein most of his mighty works
were done, because they repented
not: Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe
unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
mighty works, which were done in
you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
they would have repented long
ago in sackcloth and ashes.</p>

<p>But I say unto you, It shall be more
tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the
day of judgment, than for you. And
thou, Capernaum, which art exalted
unto heaven, shalt be brought down to
hell: for if the mighty works, which
have been done in thee, had been done
in Sodom, it would have remained
until this day. But I say unto you,
That it shall be more tolerable for the
land of Sodom in the day of judgment,
than for thee.</p>

<p>At that time Jesus answered and
said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of
heaven and earth, because thou hast
hid these things from the wise and
prudent, and hast revealed them unto
babes. Even so, Father: for so it
seemed good in thy sight. All things
are delivered unto me of my Father:
and no man knoweth the Son, but the
Father; neither knoweth any man the
Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever
the Son will reveal him. Come
unto me, all ye that labour and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of
me; for I am meek and lowly in
heart: and ye shall find rest unto your
souls. For my yoke is easy, and my
burden is light.</p>

<small>THE WOMAN THAT WAS
A SINNER</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 7</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND one of the Pharisees desired
him that he would eat with
him. And he went into the
Pharisee's house, and sat down to
meat. And, behold, a woman in the
city, which was a sinner, when she
knew that Jesus sat at meat in the
Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster
box of ointment, and stood at his
feet behind him weeping, and began
to wash his feet with tears, and did
wipe them with the hairs of her head,
and kissed his feet, and anointed
them with the ointment. Now when
the Pharisee which had bidden him
saw it, he spake within himself, saying,
This man, if he were a prophet,
would have known who and what
manner of woman this is that toucheth
him: for she is a sinner. And
Jesus answering said unto him, Simon,
I have somewhat to say unto
thee. And he saith, Master, say on.
There was a certain creditor which
had two debtors: the one owed five
hundred pence, and the other fifty.
And when they had nothing to pay,
he frankly forgave them both. Tell
me therefore, which of them will love
him most? Simon answered and
said, I suppose that he, to whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
forgave most. And he said unto him,
Thou hast rightly judged. And he
turned to the woman, and said unto
Simon, Seest thou this woman? I
entered into thine house, thou gavest
me no water for my feet: but she hath
washed my feet with tears, and wiped
them with the hairs of her head.
Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman
since the time I came in hath
not ceased to kiss my feet. My head
with oil thou didst not anoint: but this
woman hath anointed my feet with
ointment. Wherefore I say unto
thee, Her sins, which are many, are
forgiven; for she loved much: but
to whom little is forgiven, the same
loveth little. And he said unto her,
Thy sins are forgiven. And they that
sat at meat with him began to say
within themselves, Who is this that
forgiveth sins also? And he said to
the woman, Thy faith hath saved
thee; go in peace.</div>

<small>THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 13</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>ON a certain day went Jesus
out of the house, and sat by
the sea side. And great multitudes
were gathered together unto
him, so that he went into a ship, and
sat; and the whole multitude stood on
the shore. And he spake many things
unto them in parables, saying, Behold,
a sower went forth to sow; and
when he sowed, some seeds fell by the
way side, and the fowls came and devoured
them up: some fell upon
stony places, where they had not
much earth: and forthwith they
sprung up, because they had no deepness
of earth: and when the sun was
up, they were scorched; and because
they had no root, they withered away.
And some fell among thorns; and the
thorns sprung up, and choked them:
but other fell into good ground, and
brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold,
some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</div>

<p>And the disciples came, and said
unto him, Why speakest thou unto
them in parables? He answered and
said unto them, Because it is given
unto you to know the mysteries of
the kingdom of heaven, but to them
it is not given. For whosoever hath,
to him shall be given, and he shall
have more abundance: but whosoever
hath not, from him shall be taken
away even that he hath. Therefore
speak I to them in parables: because
they seeing see not; and hearing they
hear not, neither do they understand.
And in them is fulfilled the prophecy
of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye
shall hear, and shall not understand;
and seeing ye shall see, and shall
not perceive: for this people's heart
is waxed gross, and their ears are
dull of hearing, and their eyes they
have closed; lest at any time they
should see with their eyes, and hear
with their ears, and should understand
with their heart, and should be
converted, and I should heal them.
But blessed are your eyes, for they
see: and your ears, for they hear.
For verily I say unto you, That many
prophets and righteous men have desired
to see those things which ye see,
and have not seen them; and to hear
those things which ye hear, and have
not heard them.</p>

<p>Hear ye therefore the parable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
the sower. When any one heareth the
word of the kingdom, and understandeth
it not, then cometh the
wicked one, and catcheth away that
which was sown in his heart. This is
he which received seed by the way
side. But he that received the seed
into stony places, the same is he that
heareth the word, and anon with joy
receiveth it; yet hath he not root in
himself, but dureth for a while: for
when tribulation or persecution ariseth
because of the word, by and by
he is offended. He also that received
seed among the thorns is he that heareth
the word; and the care of this
world, and the deceitfulness of riches,
choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
But he that received seed
into the good ground is he that heareth
the word, and understandeth it;
which also beareth fruit, and bringeth
forth, some an hundredfold, some
sixty, some thirty.</p>

<small>THE TARES, THE MUSTARD SEED,
THE LEAVEN, ETC.</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 13</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>ANOTHER parable put he forth
unto them, saying, The kingdom
of heaven is likened unto
a man which sowed good seed in his
field: but while men slept, his enemy
came and sowed tares among the
wheat, and went his way. But when
the blade was sprung up, and brought
forth fruit, then appeared the tares
also. So the servants of the householder
came and said unto him, Sir,
didst not thou sow good seed in thy
field? from whence then hath it tares?
He said unto them, An enemy hath
done this. The servants said unto
him, Wilt thou then that we go and
gather them up? But he said, Nay;
lest while ye gather up the tares, ye
root up also the wheat with them.
Let both grow together until the harvest:
and in the time of harvest I will
say to the reapers, Gather ye together
first the tares, and bind them in bundles
to burn them: but gather the
wheat into my barn.</div>

<p>Another parable put he forth unto
them, saying, The kingdom of heaven
is like to a grain of mustard seed,
which a man took, and sowed in his
field: which indeed is the least of all
seeds: but when it is grown, it is the
greatest among herbs, and becometh
a tree, so that the birds of the air
come and lodge in the branches thereof.
Another parable spake he unto
them; The kingdom of heaven is like
unto leaven, which a woman took, and
hid in three measures of meal, till the
whole was leavened.</p>

<p>Then Jesus sent the multitude
away, and went into the house: and
his disciples came unto him, saying,
Declare unto us the parable of the
tares of the field. He answered and
said unto them, He that soweth the
good seed is the Son of man; the
field is the world; the good seed are
the children of the kingdom; but
the tares are the children of the
wicked one; the enemy that sowed
them is the devil; the harvest is
the end of the world; and the reapers
are the angels. As therefore
the tares are gathered and burned in
the fire; so shall it be in the end of
this world. The Son of man shall
send forth his angels, and they shall
gather out of his kingdom all things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
that offend, and them which do iniquity;
and shall cast them into a furnace
of fire: there shall be wailing
and gnashing of teeth. Then shall
the righteous shine forth as the
sun in the kingdom of their Father.
Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<div class="caption">CHRIST HEALING THE SICK OF THE PALSY, BY VAN DYCK<br />

</div>

<p>Again, the kingdom of heaven is
like unto treasure hid in a field; the
which when a man hath found, he
hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and
selleth all that he hath, and buyeth
that field. Again, the kingdom of
heaven is like unto a merchant man,
seeking goodly pearls: who, when he
had found one pearl of great price,
went and sold all that he had, and
bought it. Again, the kingdom of
heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
into the sea, and gathered of every
kind: which, when it was full, they
drew to shore, and sat down, and
gathered the good into vessels, but
cast the bad away. So shall it be at
the end of the world: the angels shall
come forth, and sever the wicked
from among the just, and shall cast
them into the furnace of fire: there
shall be wailing and gnashing of
teeth.</p>

<p>Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood
all these things? They say
unto him, Yea, Lord. Then said he
unto them, Therefore every scribe
which is instructed unto the kingdom
of heaven is like unto a man that is
an householder, which bringeth forth
out of his treasure things new and
old.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, that when Jesus
had finished these parables, he
departed thence. And when he was
come into his own country, he taught
them in their synagogue, insomuch
that they were astonished, and said,
Whence hath this man this wisdom,
and these mighty works? Is not this
the carpenter's son? Is not his mother
called Mary? and his brethren, James,
and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
And his sisters, are they not all with
us? Whence then hath this man all
these things? And they were offended
in him. But Jesus said unto
them, A prophet is not without honour,
save in his own country, and in
his own house. And he did not many
mighty works there because of their
unbelief.</p>

two possessed with devils, coming
out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so
that no man might pass by that way.
And, behold, they cried out, saying,
What have we to do with thee, Jesus,
thou Son of God? art thou come
hither to torment us before the time?
And there was a good way off from
them an herd of many swine feeding.
So the devils besought him, saying, If
thou cast us out, suffer us to go away
into the herd of swine. And he said
unto them, Go. And when they were
come out, they went into the herd of
swine: and, behold, the whole herd of
swine ran violently down a steep
place into the sea, and perished in the
waters. And they that kept them fled,
and went their ways into the city, and
told every thing, and what was befallen
to the possessed of the devils.
And, behold, the whole city came out
to meet Jesus: and when they saw
him, they besought him that he would
depart out of their coasts.</div>

<small>THE APOSTLES SENT FORTH</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND when he had called unto him
his twelve disciples, he gave
them power against unclean
spirits, to cast them out, and to heal
all manner of sickness and all manner
of disease. These twelve Jesus
sent forth, and commanded them, saying,
Go not into the way of the Gentiles,
and into any city of the Samaritans
enter ye not: but go rather to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel. And
as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom
of heaven is at hand. Heal the
sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the
dead, cast out devils: freely ye have
received, freely give. Provide neither
gold, nor silver, nor brass in
your purses, nor scrip for your journey,
neither two coats, neither shoes,
nor yet staves: for the workman is
worthy of his meat. And into whatsoever
city or town ye shall enter, enquire
who in it is worthy; and there
abide till ye go thence. And when ye
come into an house, salute it. And
if the house be worthy, let your peace
come upon it: but if it be not worthy,
let your peace return to you. And
whosoever shall not receive you, nor
hear your words, when ye depart out
of that house or city, shake off the
dust of your feet. Verily I say unto
you, It shall be more tolerable for the
land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the
day of judgment, than for that city.</div>

<p>Behold, I send you forth as sheep
in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore
wise as serpents, and harmless
as doves. And ye shall be hated of
all men for my name's sake: but he
that endureth to the end shall be
saved. And fear not them which kill
the body, but are not able to kill the
soul: but rather fear him which is
able to destroy both soul and body in
hell. Are not two sparrows sold for
a farthing? and one of them shall not
fall on the ground without your Father.
But the very hairs of your
head are all numbered. Fear ye not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
therefore, ye are of more value than
many sparrows. Whosoever therefore
shall confess me before men, him
will I confess also before my Father
which is in heaven. But whosoever
shall deny me before men, him will
I also deny before my Father which
is in heaven. And he that taketh not
his cross, and followeth after me, is
not worthy of me. And whosoever
shall give to drink unto one of these
little ones a cup of cold water only
in the name of a disciple, verily I say
unto you, he shall in no wise lose his
reward.</p>

<p>And they went out, and preached
that men should repent. And they cast
out many devils, and anointed with
oil many that were sick, and healed
them.</p>

<small>DEATH OF JOHN THE BAPTIST</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND king Herod heard of him;
(for his name was spread
abroad:) and he said that
John the Baptist was risen from the
dead, and therefore mighty works
shewed forth themselves in him.
Others said it was Elias, and others
that it was one of the prophets. But
when Herod heard thereof, he said,
It is John, whom I beheaded: he is
risen from the dead. For Herod himself
had sent forth and laid hold upon
John, and bound him in prison for
Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's
wife: for he had married her. For
John had said unto Herod, It is not
lawful for thee to have thy brother's
wife. Therefore Herodias had a
quarrel against him, and would have
killed him; but she could not: for
Herod feared John, knowing that he
was a just man and an holy, and observed
him; and when he heard him,
he did many things, and heard him
gladly. And when a convenient day
was come, that Herod on his birthday
made a supper to his lords, high captains,
and chief estates of Galilee;
and when the daughter of Herodias
came in, and danced, and pleased
Herod and them that sat with him,
the king said unto the damsel, Ask of
me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will
give it thee. And he sware unto her,
Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I
will give it thee, unto the half of my
kingdom. And she went forth, and
said unto her mother, What shall I
ask? And she said, The head of John
the Baptist. And she came in
straightway with haste unto the king,
and asked, saying, I will that thou
give me by and by in a charger the
head of John the Baptist. And the
king was exceeding sorry; yet for his
oath's sake, and for their sakes which
sat with him, he would not reject her.
And immediately the king sent an
executioner, and commanded his head
to be brought: and he went and beheaded
him in the prison, and brought
his head in a charger, and gave it to
the damsel: and the damsel gave it
to her mother. And when his disciples
heard of it, they came and took
up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
And they went and told Jesus.</div>

and when the people had heard thereof,
they followed him on foot out of
the cities. And Jesus went forth, and
saw a great multitude, and was moved
with compassion toward them, and he
healed their sick. And when it was
evening, his disciples came to him,
saying, This is a desert place, and
the time is now past; send the multitude
away, that they may go into the
villages, and buy themselves victuals.
But Jesus said unto them, They need
not depart; give ye them to eat.
And they say unto him, We have here
but five loaves, and two fishes. He
said, Bring them hither to me. And
he commanded the multitude to sit
down on the grass, and took the five
loaves, and the two fishes, and looking
up to heaven, he blessed, and brake,
and gave the loaves to his disciples,
and the disciples to the multitude.
And they did all eat, and were filled:
and they took up of the fragments
that remained twelve baskets full.
And they that had eaten were about
five thousand men, beside women and

<small>JESUS WALKS ON THE SEA</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 14</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND straightway Jesus constrained
his disciples to get
into a ship, and to go before
him unto the other side, while he sent
the multitudes away, because he perceived
that they were about to come
and take him by force, to make him
king. And when he had sent the multitudes
away, he went up into a mountain
apart to pray: and when the
evening was come, he was there alone.
But the ship was now in the midst of
the sea, tossed with waves: for the
wind was contrary. And in the
fourth watch of the night Jesus went
unto them, walking on the sea. And
when the disciples saw him walking
on the sea, they were troubled, saying,
It is a spirit; and they cried out for
fear. But straightway Jesus spake
unto them, saying, Be of good cheer;
it is I; be not afraid. And Peter answered
him and said, Lord, if it be
thou, bid me come unto thee on the
water. And he said, Come. And
when Peter was come down out of the
ship, he walked on the water, to go
to Jesus. But when he saw the wind
boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning
to sink, he cried, saying, Lord,
save me. And immediately Jesus
stretched forth his hand, and caught
him, and said unto him, O thou of
little faith, wherefore didst thou
doubt? And when they were come
into the ship, the wind ceased. Then
they that were in the ship came and
worshipped him, saying, Of a truth
thou art the Son of God. And when
they were gone over, they came into
the land of Gennesaret. And when
the men of that place had knowledge
of him, they sent out into all that
country round about, and brought
unto him all that were diseased; and
besought him that they might only
touch the hem of his garment: and
as many as touched were made perfectly

<small>JESUS THE BREAD OF LIFE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 6</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE day following, when the
people which stood on the
other side of the sea saw that
there was none other boat there, save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
that one whereinto his disciples were
entered, and that Jesus went not with
his disciples into the boat, but that
his disciples were gone away alone:
when the people therefore saw that
Jesus was not there, neither his disciples,
they also took shipping, and
came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
And when they had found him
on the other side of the sea, they said
unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou
hither? Jesus answered them and
said, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
Ye seek me, not because ye saw the
miracles, but because ye did eat of
the loaves, and were filled. Labour
not for the meat which perisheth, but
for that meat which endureth unto
everlasting life, which the Son of man
shall give unto you: for him hath God
the Father sealed. Then said they
unto him, What shall we do, that we
might work the works of God? Jesus
answered and said unto them, This
is the work of God, that ye believe
on him whom he hath sent. They
said therefore unto him, What sign
shewest thou then, that we may see,
and believe thee? what dost thou
work? Our fathers did eat manna in
the desert; as it is written, He gave
them bread from heaven to eat.
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Moses gave
you not that bread from heaven; but
my Father giveth you the true bread
from heaven. For the bread of God
is he which cometh down from heaven,
and giveth life unto the world.
Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore
give us this bread. And Jesus
said unto them, I am the bread of life:
he that cometh to me shall never hunger;
and he that believeth on me shall
never thirst. But I said unto you that
ye also have seen me, and believe
not. All that the Father giveth me
shall come to me; and him that cometh
to me I will in no wise cast out.
For I came down from heaven, not
to do mine own will, but the will of
him that sent me. And this is the
Father's will which hath sent me,
that of all which he hath given me
I should lose nothing, but should
raise it up again at the last day. And
this is the will of him that sent me,
that every one which seeth the Son,
and believeth on him, may have everlasting
life: and I will raise him up
at the last day.</div>

<p>The Jews then murmured at him,
because he said, I am the bread which
came down from heaven. And they
said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph,
whose father and mother we
know? how is it then that he saith, I
came down from heaven? Jesus
therefore answered and said unto
them, Murmur not among yourselves.
No man can come to me, except the
Father which hath sent me draw him:
and I will raise him up at the last
day. It is written in the prophets,
And they shall be all taught of God.
Every man therefore that hath heard,
and hath learned of the Father, cometh
unto me. Not that any man hath
seen the Father, save he which is of
God, he hath seen the Father. Verily,
verily, I say unto you, He that
believeth on me hath everlasting life.
I am that bread of life. Your fathers
did eat manna in the wilderness, and
are dead. This is the bread which
cometh down from heaven, that a man
may eat thereof, and not die. I am
the living bread which came down
from heaven: if any man eat of this
bread, he shall live for ever: and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
bread that I will give is my flesh,
which I will give for the life of the
world.</p>

<p>The Jews therefore strove among
themselves, saying, How can this man
give us his flesh to eat? Then Jesus
said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of
the Son of man, and drink his blood,
ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth
my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath
eternal life; and I will raise him up
at the last day. For my flesh is meat
indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh
my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in
him. As the living Father hath sent
me, and I live by the Father: so he
that eateth me, even he shall live by
me. This is that bread which came
down from heaven: not as your fathers
did eat manna, and are dead:
he that eateth of this bread shall live
for ever.</p>

<p>These things said he in the synagogue,
as he taught in Capernaum.
Many therefore of his disciples, when
they heard this, said, This is an hard
saying; who can hear it? When Jesus
knew in himself that his disciples
murmured at it, he said unto them,
Doth this offend you? What and if
ye shall see the Son of man ascend up
where he was before? It is the spirit
that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
nothing: the words that I speak unto
you, they are spirit, and they are life.
But there are some of you that believe
not. For Jesus knew from the
beginning who they were that believed
not, and who should betray
him. And he said, Therefore said I
unto you, that no man can come unto
me, except it were given unto him of
my Father.</p>

<p>From that time many of his disciples
went back, and walked no more
with him. Then said Jesus unto the
twelve, Will ye also go away? Then
Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to
whom shall we go? thou hast the
words of eternal life. And we believe
and are sure that thou art that Christ,
the Son of the living God. Jesus answered
them, Have not I chosen you
twelve, and one of you is a devil? He
spake of Judas Iscariot the son of
Simon: for he it was that should betray
him, being one of the twelve.</p>

<small>THE GREEK WOMAN'S DAUGHTER
AND A DEAF AND DUMB
MAN HEALED</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Mark 7</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND from thence he arose, and
went into the borders of Tyre
and Sidon, and entered into
an house, and would have no man
know it: but he could not be hid. For
a certain woman, whose young daughter
had an unclean spirit, heard of
him, and came and fell at his feet:
the woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician
by nation; and she besought
him that he would cast forth the devil
out of her daughter. But Jesus said
unto her, Let the children first be
filled: for it is not meet to take the
children's bread, and to cast it unto
the dogs. And she answered and said
unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs
under the table eat of the children's
crumbs. And he said unto her, For
this saying go thy way; the devil is
gone out of thy daughter. And when
she was come to her house, she found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the devil gone out, and her daughter
laid upon the bed.</div>

<p>And again, departing from the
coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came
unto the sea of Galilee, through the
midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
And they bring unto him one that
was deaf, and had an impediment in
his speech; and they beseech him to
put his hand upon him. And he took
him aside from the multitude, and
put his fingers into his ears, and he
spit, and touched his tongue; and
looking up to heaven, he sighed, and
saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is,
Be opened. And straightway his
ears were opened, and the string of
his tongue was loosed, and he spake
plain. And he charged them that
they should tell no man: but the more
he charged them, so much the more
a great deal they published it; and
were beyond measure astonished, saying,
He hath done all things well: he
maketh both the deaf to hear, and the

<small>JESUS FEEDS THE MULTITUDE
A SECOND TIME</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Mark 8</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>IN those days the multitude being
very great, and having nothing
to eat, Jesus called his disciples
unto him, and saith unto them, I
have compassion on the multitude,
because they have now been with me
three days, and have nothing to eat:
and if I send them away fasting to
their own houses, they will faint by
the way: for divers of them came
from far.</div>

<p>And his disciples answered him,
From whence can a man satisfy these
men with bread here in the wilderness?
And he asked them, How many
loaves have ye? And they said,
Seven. And he commanded the people
to sit down on the ground: and
he took the seven loaves, and gave
thanks, and brake, and gave to his
disciples to set before them; and
they did set them before the people.
And they had a few small fishes: and
he blessed, and commanded to set
them also before them. So they did
eat, and were filled: and they took up
of the broken meat that was left seven
baskets. And they that had eaten
were about four thousand: and he
sent them away.</p>

<p>And straightway he entered into a
ship with his disciples, and came into
the parts of Dalmanutha. And the
Pharisees came forth, and began to
question with him, seeking of him a
sign from heaven, tempting him.
And he sighed deeply in his spirit,
and saith, Why doth this generation
seek after a sign? verily I say unto
you, There shall no sign be given
unto this generation. And he left
them, and entering into the ship again
departed to the other side. Now the
disciples had forgotten to take bread,
neither had they in the ship with
them more than one loaf. And he
charged them, saying, Take heed, beware
of the leaven of the Pharisees,
and of the leaven of Herod. And
they reasoned among themselves, saying,
It is because we have no bread.
And when Jesus knew it, he saith
unto them, Why reason ye, because
ye have no bread? perceive ye not
yet, neither understand? have ye
your heart yet hardened? Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
eyes, see ye not? and having ears,
hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
When I brake the five loaves among
five thousand, how many baskets full
of fragments took ye up? They say
unto him, Twelve. And when the
seven among four thousand, how
many baskets full of fragments took
ye up? And they said, Seven. And
he said unto them, How is it that ye
do not understand?</p>

<p>And he cometh to Bethsaida; and
they bring a blind man unto him, and
besought him to touch him. And he
took the blind man by the hand, and
led him out of the town; and when he
had spit on his eyes, and put his
hands upon him, he asked him if he
saw ought. And he looked up, and
said, I see men as trees, walking.
After that he put his hands again
upon his eyes, and made him look up:
and he was restored, and saw every
man clearly. And he sent him away
to his house, saying, Neither go into
the town, nor tell it to any in the town.</p>

<small>PETER CONFESSES CHRIST</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 16</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>WHEN Jesus came into the
coasts of Cæsarea Philippi,
he asked his disciples, saying,
Whom do men say that I the Son
of man am? And they said, Some
say that thou art John the Baptist:
some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or
one of the prophets. He saith unto
them, But whom say ye that I am?
And Simon Peter answered and said,
Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
living God. And Jesus answered and
said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
Bar-jona: for flesh and blood
hath not revealed it unto thee, but my
Father which is in heaven. And I
say also unto thee, That thou art Peter,
and upon this rock I will build my
church; and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it. And I will
give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
of heaven: and whatsoever thou
shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt
loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven. Then charged he his disciples
that they should tell no man that
he was Jesus the Christ.</div>

<p>From that time forth began Jesus
to shew unto his disciples, how that
he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer
many things of the elders and
chief priests and scribes, and be
killed, and be raised again the third
day. Then Peter took him, and began
to rebuke him, saying, Be it far
from thee, Lord: this shall not be
unto thee. But he turned, and said
unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
thou art an offence unto me: for
thou savourest not the things that be
of God, but those that be of men.</p>

<p>Then said Jesus unto his disciples,
If any man will come after me, let
him deny himself, and take up his
cross, and follow me. For whosoever
will save his life shall lose it: and
whosoever will lose his life for my
sake shall find it. For what is a man
profited, if he shall gain the whole
world, and lose his own soul? or what
shall a man give in exchange for his
soul? For the Son of man shall come
in the glory of his Father with his
angels; and then he shall reward
every man according to his works.</p>

with him Peter, and James,
and John, and leadeth them
up into an high mountain apart by
themselves: and he was transfigured
before them. And his raiment became
shining, exceeding white as
snow; so as no fuller on earth can
white them. And there appeared
unto them Elias with Moses: and they
were talking with Jesus. And Peter
answered and said to Jesus, Master,
it is good for us to be here: and let
us make three tabernacles; one for
thee, and one for Moses, and one for
Elias. For he wist not what to say;
for they were sore afraid. And there
was a cloud that overshadowed them:
and a voice came out of the cloud, saying,
This is my beloved Son: hear
him. And suddenly, when they had
looked round about, they saw no man
any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
And as they came down from
the mountain, he charged them that
they should tell no man what things
they had seen, till the Son of man
were risen from the dead. And they
kept that saying with themselves,
questioning one with another what

he saw a great multitude about them,

them. And straightway all the people,
when they beheld him, were
greatly amazed, and running to him
saluted him. And he asked the
scribes, What question ye with them?
And one of the multitude answered
and said, Master, I have brought unto
thee my son, which hath a dumb
spirit; and wheresoever he taketh
him, he teareth him: and he foameth,
and gnasheth with his teeth, and
pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples
that they should cast him out;
and they could not. He answereth
him, and saith, O faithless generation,
how long shall I be with you?
how long shall I suffer you? bring
him unto me. And they brought him
unto him: and when he saw him,
straightway the spirit tare him; and
he fell on the ground, and wallowed
foaming. And he asked his father,
How long is it ago since this came
unto him? And he said, Of a child.
And ofttimes it hath cast him into the
fire, and into the waters, to destroy
him: but if thou canst do anything,
have compassion on us, and help us.
Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe,
all things are possible to him
that believeth. And straightway the
father of the child cried out, and said
with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou
mine unbelief. When Jesus saw that
the people came running together, he
rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto
him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I
charge thee, come out of him, and
enter no more into him. And the
spirit cried, and rent him sore, and
came out of him: and he was as one
dead; insomuch that many said, He
is dead. But Jesus took him by the
hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
And when he was come into the
house, his disciples asked him privately,
Why could not we cast him
out? And he said unto them, This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>

<p>And they departed thence, and

not that any man should know it.
For he taught his disciples, and said

into the hands of men, and they
shall kill him; and after that he is
killed, he shall rise the third day.

hanged about his neck, and that
he were drowned in the depth of
the sea. Take heed that ye despise
not one of these little ones; for I say
unto you, That in heaven their angels
do always behold the face of my Father
which is in heaven. For the Son
of man is come to save that which was
lost. How think ye? if a man have
an hundred sheep, and one of them
be gone astray, doth he not leave the
ninety and nine, and goeth into the
mountains, and seeketh that which is
gone astray? And if so be that he
find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth
more of that sheep, than of
the ninety and nine which went not
astray. Even so it is not the will of
your Father which is in heaven, that
one of these little ones should perish.</div>

<p>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass
against thee, go and tell him his
fault between thee and him alone: if
he shall hear thee, thou hast gained
thy brother. But if he will not hear
thee, then take with thee one or two
more, that in the mouth of two or
three witnesses every word may be
established. And if he shall neglect
to hear them, tell it unto the church:
but if he neglect to hear the church,
let him be unto thee as an heathen
man and a publican. Verily I say
unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind
on earth shall be bound in heaven:
and whatsoever ye shall loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Again I say unto you, That if two of
you shall agree on earth as touching
any thing that they shall ask, it shall
be done for them of my Father which
is in heaven. For where two or three
are gathered together in my name,
there am I in the midst of them.</p>

<p>Then came Peter to him, and said,
Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
against me, and I forgive him? till
seven times? Jesus saith unto him,
I say not unto thee, Until seven
times: but, Until seventy times seven.
Therefore is the kingdom of heaven
likened unto a certain king, which
would take account of his servants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
And when he had begun to reckon,
one was brought unto him, which
owed him ten thousand talents. But
forasmuch as he had not to pay, his
lord commanded him to be sold, and
his wife, and children, and all that
he had, and payment to be made.
The servant therefore fell down, and
worshipped him, saying, Lord, have
patience with me, and I will pay thee
all. Then the lord of that servant
was moved with compassion, and
loosed him, and forgave him the debt.
But the same servant went out, and
found one of his fellowservants,
which owed him an hundred pence:
and he laid hands on him, and took
him by the throat, saying, Pay me
that thou owest. And his fellowservant
fell down at his feet, and besought
him, saying, Have patience
with me, and I will pay thee all. And
he would not: but went and cast him
into prison, till he should pay the
debt. So when his fellowservants saw
what was done, they were very sorry,
and came and told unto their lord all
that was done. Then his lord, after
that he had called him, said unto him,
O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee
all that debt, because thou desiredst
me: shouldest not thou also have had
compassion on thy fellowservant,
even as I had pity on thee? And his
lord was wroth, and delivered him to
the tormentors, till he should pay all
that was due unto him. So likewise
shall my heavenly Father do also
unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive
not every one his brother their
trespasses. And he turned him unto
his disciples, and said privately,
Blessed are the eyes which see the
things that ye see: for I tell you, that
many prophets and kings have desired
to see those things which ye see,
and have not seen them; and to hear
those things which ye hear, and have
not heard them.</p>

<small>JESUS AT THE FEAST OF
TABERNACLES</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 7</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AFTER these things Jesus walked
in Galilee: for he would not
walk in Jewry, because the
Jews sought to kill him. Now the
Jews' feast of tabernacles was at
hand. His brethren therefore said
unto him, Depart hence, and go into
Judæa, that thy disciples also may
see the works that thou doest. For
there is no man that doeth any thing
in secret, and he himself seeketh to
be known openly. If thou do these
things, shew thyself to the world.
For neither did his brethren believe
in him. Then Jesus said unto them,
My time is not yet come: but your
time is alway ready. The world cannot
hate you; but me it hateth, because
I testify of it, that the works
thereof are evil. Go ye up unto this
feast: I go not up yet unto this feast;
for my time is not yet full come.
When he had said these words unto
them, he abode still in Galilee.</div>

<p>But when his brethren were gone
up, then went he also up unto the
feast, not openly, but as it were in
secret. Then the Jews sought him
at the feast, and said, Where is he?
And there was much murmuring
among the people concerning him:
for some said, He is a good man:
others said, Nay; but he deceiveth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
the people. Howbeit no man spake
openly of him for fear of the Jews.</p>

<p>Now about the midst of the feast
Jesus went up into the temple, and
taught. And the Jews marvelled,
saying, How knoweth this man letters,
having never learned? Jesus
answered them, and said, My doctrine
is not mine, but his that sent me.
If any man will do his will, he shall
know of the doctrine, whether it be of
God, or whether I speak of myself.
He that speaketh of himself seeketh
his own glory: but he that seeketh
his glory that sent him, the same is
true, and no unrighteousness is in
him. Did not Moses give you the law,
and yet none of you keepeth the law?
Why go ye about to kill me? The people
answered and said, Thou hast a
devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
Then said some of them of Jerusalem,
Is not this he, whom they seek
to kill? But, lo, he speaketh boldly,
and they say nothing unto him. Do
the rulers know indeed that this is
the very Christ? Howbeit we know
this man whence he is: but when
Christ cometh, no man knoweth
whence he is.</p>

<p>Then cried Jesus in the temple as
he taught, saying, Ye both know me,
and ye know whence I am: and I am
not come of myself, but he that sent
me is true, whom ye know not. But
I know him: for I am from him, and
he hath sent me. Then they sought
to take him: but no man laid hands
on him, because his hour was not yet
come. And many of the people believed
on him, and said, When Christ
cometh, will he do more miracles than
these which this man hath done?</p>

<p>The Pharisees heard that the people
murmured such things concerning
him; and the Pharisees and the chief
priests sent officers to take him. Then
said Jesus unto them, Yet a little
while am I with you, and then I go
unto him that sent me. Ye shall seek
me, and shall not find me: and where
I am, thither ye cannot come. Then
said the Jews among themselves,
Whither will he go, that we shall not
find him? will he go unto the dispersed
among the Gentiles, and teach
the Gentiles? What manner of saying
is this that he said, Ye shall seek
me, and shall not find me: and where
I am, thither ye cannot come? In
the last day, that great day of the
feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying,
If any man thirst, let him come unto
me, and drink. He that believeth on
me, as the scripture hath said, out of
his belly shall flow rivers of living
water. (But this spake he of the
Spirit, which they that believe on
him should receive: for the Holy
Ghost was not yet given; because that
Jesus was not yet glorified.)</p>

<p>Many of the people therefore, when
they heard this saying, said, Of a
truth this is the Prophet. Others
said, This is the Christ. But some
said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
Hath not the scripture said that
Christ cometh of the seed of David,
and out of the town of Bethlehem,
where David was? So there was a
division among the people because of
him. And some of them would have
taken him; but no man laid hands on
him.</p>

<p>Then came the officers to the chief
priests and Pharisees; and they said
unto them, Why have ye not brought
him? The officers answered, Never
man spake like this man. Then answered
them the Pharisees, Are ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
also deceived? Have any of the rulers
or of the Pharisees believed on
him? But this people who knoweth
not the law are cursed. Nicodemus
saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus
by night, being one of them,)
Doth our law judge any man, before
it hear him, and know what he doeth?
They answered and said unto him,
Art thou also of Galilee? Search,
and look: for out of Galilee ariseth
no prophet. And every man went
unto his own house.</p>

<small>THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 8</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>JESUS went unto the mount of
Olives. And early in the
morning he came again into
the temple, and all the people came
unto him; and he sat down, and taught
them. And the scribes and Pharisees
brought unto him a woman taken in
adultery; and when they had set her
in the midst, they say unto him, Master,
this woman was taken in adultery,
in the very act. Now Moses in
the law commanded us, that such
should be stoned: but what sayest
thou? This they said, tempting him,
that they might have to accuse him.
But Jesus stooped down, and with his
finger wrote on the ground, as though
he heard them not. So when they
continued asking him, he lifted up
himself, and said unto them, He that
is without sin among you, let him first
cast a stone at her. And again he
stooped down, and wrote on the
ground. And they which heard it,
being convicted by their own conscience,
went out one by one, beginning
at the eldest, even unto the
last: and Jesus was left alone, and
the woman standing in the midst.
When Jesus had lifted up himself,
and saw none but the woman, he said
unto her, Woman, where are those
thine accusers? hath no man condemned
thee? She said, No man,
Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither
do I condemn thee: go, and sin
no more.</div>

<p>Then spake Jesus again unto them,
saying, I am the light of the world:
he that followeth me shall not walk
in darkness, but shall have the light
of life. The Pharisees therefore said
unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself;
thy record is not true. Jesus
answered and said unto them, Though
I bear record of myself, yet my record
is true: for I know whence I
came, and whither I go; but ye cannot
tell whence I come, and whither
I go. Ye judge after the flesh; I
judge no man. And yet if I judge,
my judgment is true: for I am not
alone, but I and the Father that sent
me. It is also written in your law,
that the testimony of two men is true.
I am one that bear witness of myself,
and the Father that sent me beareth
witness of me. Then said they unto
him, Where is thy Father? Jesus
answered, Ye neither know me, nor
my Father: if ye had known me, ye
should have known my Father also.
These words spake Jesus in the treasury,
as he taught in the temple: and
no man laid hands on him; for his
hour was not yet come.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, Ye are
from beneath; I am from above: ye
are of this world; I am not of this
world. I said therefore unto you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
that ye shall die in your sins: for if
ye believe not that I am he, ye shall
die in your sins. Then said they unto
him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith
unto them, Even the same that I said
unto you from the beginning. I have
many things to say and to judge of
you: but he that sent me is true; and
I speak to the world those things
which I have heard of him. They understood
not that he spake to them of
the Father. Then said Jesus unto
them, When ye have lifted up the
Son of man, then shall ye know that
I am he, and that I do nothing of myself;
but as my Father hath taught
me, I speak these things. And he
that sent me is with me: the Father
hath not left me alone; for I do always
those things that please him.
As he spake these words, many believed
on him.</p>

<p>Then said Jesus to those Jews
which believed on him, If ye continue
in my word, then are ye my disciples
indeed; and ye shall know the truth,
and the truth shall make you free.
They answered him, We be Abraham's
seed, and were never in bondage
to any man: how sayest thou,
Ye shall be made free? Jesus answered
them, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Whosoever committeth sin
is the servant of sin. And the servant
abideth not in the house for
ever: but the Son abideth ever. If
the Son therefore shall make you
free, ye shall be free indeed. I know
that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye
seek to kill me, because my word hath
no place in you. I speak that which
I have seen with my Father: and ye
do that which ye have seen with your
father. They answered and said unto
him, Abraham is our father.</p>

<p>Jesus saith unto them, If ye were
Abraham's children, ye would do the
works of Abraham. But now ye seek
to kill me, a man that hath told you
the truth, which I have heard of God:
this did not Abraham. Ye do the
deeds of your father. Then said they
to him, We have one Father, even
God. Jesus said unto them, If God
were your Father, ye would love me:
for I proceeded forth and came from
God; neither came I of myself, but
he sent me. Why do ye not understand
my speech? even because ye
cannot hear my word. Ye are of your
father the devil, and the lusts of your
father ye will do. He was a murderer
from the beginning, and abode
not in the truth, because there is no
truth in him. When he speaketh a
lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is
a liar, and the father of it. And because
I tell you the truth, ye believe
me not. Which of you convinceth
me of sin? And if I say the truth,
why do ye not believe me? He that
is of God heareth God's words: ye
therefore hear them not, because ye
are not of God. Then answered the
Jews, and said unto him, Say we not
well that thou art a Samaritan, and
hast a devil? Jesus answered, I have
not a devil; but I honour my Father,
and ye do dishonour me. And I seek
not mine own glory: there is one that
seeketh and judgeth. Verily, verily,
I say unto you, If a man keep my
saying, he shall never see death.</p>

<p>Then said the Jews unto him, Now
we know that thou hast a devil.
Abraham is dead, and the prophets;
and thou sayest, If a man keep my
saying, he shall never taste of death.
Art thou greater than our father
Abraham, which is dead? and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
prophets are dead: whom makest
thou thyself? Jesus answered, If I
honour myself, my honour is nothing:
it is my Father that honoureth me;
of whom ye say, that he is your God:
yet ye have not known him; but I
know him: and if I should say, I know
him not, I shall be a liar like unto you:
but I know him, and keep his saying.
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see
my day: and he saw it, and was glad.
Then said the Jews unto him, Thou
art not yet fifty years old, and hast
thou seen Abraham? Jesus said unto
them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
Before Abraham was, I am. Then
took they up stones to cast at him:
but Jesus hid himself, and went out
of the temple, going through the
midst of them, and so passed by.</p>

<small>THE GOOD SAMARITAN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 10</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND, behold, a certain lawyer
stood up, and tempted him,
saying, Master, what shall I
do to inherit eternal life? He said
unto him, What is written in the law?
how readest thou? And he answering
said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy strength,
and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour
as thyself. And he said unto
him, Thou hast answered right: this
do, and thou shalt live. But he, willing
to justify himself, said unto Jesus,
And who is my neighbour? And
Jesus answering said, A certain man
went down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
and fell among thieves, which
stripped him of his raiment, and
wounded him, and departed, leaving
him half dead. And by chance there
came down a certain priest that way:
and when he saw him, he passed by
on the other side. And likewise a
Levite, when he was at the place,
came and looked on him, and passed
by on the other side. But a certain
Samaritan, as he journeyed, came
where he was: and when he saw him,
he had compassion on him, and went
to him, and bound up his wounds,
pouring in oil and wine, and set him
on his own beast, and brought him to
an inn, and took care of him. And
on the morrow when he departed, he
took out two pence, and gave them to
the host, and said unto him, Take care
of him; and whatsoever thou spendest
more, when I come again, I will
repay thee. Which now of these
three, thinkest thou, was neighbour
unto him that fell among the thieves?
And he said, He that shewed mercy
on him. Then said Jesus unto him,
Go, and do thou likewise.</div>

<p>Now it came to pass, as they went,
that he entered into a certain village:
and a certain woman named Martha
received him into her house. And
she had a sister called Mary, which
also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his
word. But Martha was cumbered
about much serving, and came to him,
and said, Lord, dost thou not care
that my sister hath left me to serve
alone? bid her therefore that she help
me. And Jesus answered and said
unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art
careful and troubled about many
things: but one thing is needful: and
Mary hath chosen that good part,
which shall not be taken away from
her.</p>

<small>THE LORD'S PRAYER AND OTHER
SAYINGS OF CHRIST</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 11</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, that, as he
was praying in a certain
place, when he ceased, one of
his disciples said unto him, Lord,
teach us to pray, as John also taught
his disciples. And he said unto them,
When ye pray, say, Our Father which
art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
done, as in heaven, so in earth. Give
us day by day our daily bread. And
forgive us our sins; for we also forgive
every one that is indebted to us.
And lead us not into temptation; but
deliver us from evil.</div>

<p>And he said unto them, Which of
you shall have a friend, and shall go
unto him at midnight, and say unto
him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
for a friend of mine in his journey
is come to me, and I have nothing
to set before him? And he from
within shall answer and say, Trouble
me not: the door is now shut, and my
children are with me in bed; I cannot
rise and give thee. I say unto you,
Though he will not rise and give him,
because he is his friend, yet because
of his importunity he will rise and
give him as many as he needeth.
And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall
be given you; seek, and ye shall find;
knock, and it shall be opened unto
you. For every one that asketh receiveth;
and he that seeketh findeth;
and to him that knocketh it shall be
opened. If a son shall ask bread of
any of you that is a father, will he
give him a stone? or if he ask a fish,
will he for a fish give him a serpent?
or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer
him a scorpion? If ye then, being
evil, know how to give good gifts
unto your children: how much more
shall your heavenly Father give the
Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</p>

<p>And he was casting out a devil, and
it was dumb. And it came to pass,
when the devil was gone out, the
dumb spake; and the people wondered.
But some of them said, He
casteth out devils through Beelzebub
the chief of the devils. And others,
tempting him, sought of him a sign
from heaven. But he, knowing their
thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
divided against itself is brought
to desolation; and a house divided
against a house falleth. If Satan also
be divided against himself, how shall
his kingdom stand? because ye say
that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
And if I by Beelzebub cast out
devils, by whom do your sons cast
them out? therefore shall they be
your judges. But if I with the finger
of God cast out devils, no doubt the
kingdom of God is come upon you.
When a strong man armed keepeth
his palace, his goods are in peace:
but when a stronger than he shall
come upon him, and overcome him,
he taketh from him all his armour
wherein he trusted, and divideth his
spoils. He that is not with me is
against me: and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth. When the unclean
spirit is gone out of a man, he
walketh through dry places, seeking
rest; and finding none, he saith, I will
return unto my house whence I came
out. And when he cometh, he findeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
it swept and garnished. Then goeth
he, and taketh to him seven other
spirits more wicked than himself;
and they enter in, and dwell there:
and the last state of that man is worse
than the first.</p>

<span class='location'>IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY, LONDON</span></div>
</div>

<p>And as he spake, a certain Pharisee
besought him to dine with him:
and he went in, and sat down to meat.
And when the Pharisee saw it, he
marvelled that he had not first
washed before dinner. And the Lord
said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees
make clean the outside of the cup and
the platter; but your inward part is
full of ravening and wickedness. Ye
fools, did not he that made that which
is without make that which is within
also? But rather give alms of such
things as ye have; and, behold, all
things are clean unto you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 12</div>

<p>When there were gathered together
an innumerable multitude of
people, insomuch that they trode one
upon another, he began to say unto
his disciples first of all, Beware ye of
the leaven of the Pharisees, which is
hypocrisy. For there is nothing covered,
that shall not be revealed; neither
hid, that shall not be known.
Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken
in darkness shall be heard in the
light; and that which ye have spoken
in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed
upon the housetops. And I
say unto you my friends, Be not
afraid of them that kill the body, and
after that have no more that they can
do. But I will forewarn you whom
ye shall fear: Fear him, which after
he hath killed hath power to cast into
hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
Are not five sparrows sold for two
farthings, and not one of them is forgotten
before God? But even the
very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Fear not therefore: ye are of
more value than many sparrows.</p>

<p>Also I say unto you, Whosoever
shall confess me before men, him
shall the Son of man also confess before
the angels of God: but he that
denieth me before men shall be denied
before the angels of God. And
whosoever shall speak a word against
the Son of man, it shall be forgiven
him: but unto him that blasphemeth
against the Holy Ghost it shall not be
forgiven. And when they bring you
unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates,
and powers, take ye no thought
how or what thing ye shall answer,
or what ye shall say: for the Holy
Ghost shall teach you in the same
hour what ye ought to say.</p>

<p>And one of the company said unto
him, Master, speak to my brother,
that he divide the inheritance with
me. And he said unto him, Man, who
made me a judge or a divider over
you? And he said unto them, Take
heed, and beware of covetousness:
for a man's life consisteth not in the
abundance of the things which he
possesseth. And he spake a parable
unto them, saying, The ground of a
certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
and he thought within himself,
saying, What shall I do, because
I have no room where to bestow my
fruits? And he said, This will I do:
I will pull down my barns, and build
greater; and there will I bestow all
my fruits and my goods. And I will
say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much
goods laid up for many years; take
thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.
But God said unto him, Thou fool,
this night thy soul shall be required
of thee: then whose shall those things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
be, which thou hast provided? So is
he that layeth up treasure for himself,
and is not rich toward God.</p>

<p>And he said unto his disciples,
Therefore I say unto you, Take no
thought for your life, what ye shall
eat; neither for the body, what ye
shall put on. The life is more than
meat, and the body is more than raiment.
Consider the ravens: for they
neither sow nor reap; which neither
have storehouse nor barn; and God
feedeth them: how much more are
ye better than the fowls? And which
of you with taking thought can add
to his stature one cubit? If ye then
be not able to do that thing which is
least, why take ye thought for the
rest? Consider the lilies how they
grow: they toil not, they spin not;
and yet I say unto you, that Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like
one of these. If then God so clothe
the grass, which is to day in the field,
and to morrow is cast into the oven;
how much more will he clothe you, O
ye of little faith? And seek not ye
what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.
For all these things do the nations
of the world seek after: and your Father
knoweth that ye have need of
these things. But rather seek ye the
kingdom of God; and all these things
shall be added unto you. Fear not,
little flock; for it is your Father's
good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</p>

<p>Let your loins be girded about, and
your lights burning; and ye yourselves
like unto men that wait for
their lord, when he will return from
the wedding; that when he cometh
and knocketh, they may open unto
him immediately. Blessed are those
servants, whom the lord when he cometh
shall find watching: verily I say
unto you, that he shall gird himself,
and make them to sit down to meat,
and will come forth and serve them.
And if he shall come in the second
watch, or come in the third watch,
and find them so, blessed are those
servants. And this know, that if the
goodman of the house had known
what hour the thief would come, he
would have watched, and not have
suffered his house to be broken
through. Be ye therefore ready also:
for the Son of man cometh at an hour
when ye think not.</p>

<p>Then Peter said unto him, Lord,
speakest thou this parable unto us, or
even to all? And the Lord said, Who
then is that faithful and wise steward,
whom his lord shall make ruler over
his household, to give them their portion
of meat in due season? Blessed
is that servant, whom his lord when
he cometh shall find so doing. Of a
truth I say unto you, that he will
make him ruler over all that he hath.
But and if that servant say in his
heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
and shall begin to beat the menservants
and maidens, and to eat and
drink, and to be drunken; the lord of
that servant will come in a day when
he looketh not for him, and at an hour
when he is not aware, and will cut
him in sunder, and will appoint him
his portion with the unbelievers.
And that servant, which knew his
lord's will, and prepared not himself,
neither did according to his will, shall
be beaten with many stripes. But he
that knew not, and did commit things
worthy of stripes, shall be beaten
with few stripes. For unto whomsoever
much is given, of him shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
much required: and to whom men
have committed much, of him they
will ask the more.</p>

<p>He spake also this parable; A certain
man had a fig tree planted in his
vineyard; and he came and sought
fruit thereon, and found none. Then
said he unto the dresser of his vineyard,
Behold, these three years I
come seeking fruit on this fig tree,
and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth
it the ground? And he answering
said unto him, Lord, let it
alone this year also, till I shall dig
about it, and dung it: and if it bear
fruit, well: and if not, then after that
thou shalt cut it down.</p>

<p>And he was teaching in one of the
synagogues on the sabbath. And, behold,
there was a woman which had
a spirit of infirmity eighteen years,
and was bowed together, and could
in no wise lift up herself. And when
Jesus saw her, he called her to him,
and said unto her, Woman, thou art
loosed from thine infirmity. And he
laid his hands on her: and immediately
she was made straight, and
glorified God. And the ruler of the
synagogue answered with indignation,
because that Jesus had healed
on the sabbath day, and said unto the
people, There are six days in which
men ought to work: in them therefore
come and be healed, and not on
the sabbath day. The Lord then answered
him, and said, Thou hypocrite,
doth not each one of you on the
sabbath loose his ox or his ass from
the stall, and lead him away to watering?
And ought not this woman,
being a daughter of Abraham, whom
Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen
years, be loosed from this bond on the
sabbath day? And when he had said
these things, all his adversaries were
ashamed: and all the people rejoiced
for all the glorious things that were
done by him.</p>

<small>THE BLIND MAN AT THE
POOL OF SILOAM</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 9</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND as Jesus passed by, he saw
a man which was blind from
his birth. And his disciples
asked him, saying, Master, who did
sin, this man, or his parents, that he
was born blind? Jesus answered,
Neither hath this man sinned, nor his
parents: but that the works of God
should be made manifest in him. I
must work the works of him that sent
me, while it is day: the night cometh,
when no man can work. As long as
I am in the world, I am the light of
the world. When he had thus spoken,
he spat on the ground, and made
clay of the spittle, and he anointed
the eyes of the blind man with the
clay, and said unto him, Go, wash in
the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation,
Sent.) He went his
way therefore, and washed, and came
seeing.</div>

<p>The neighbours therefore, and
they which before had seen him that
he was blind, said, Is not this he that
sat and begged? Some said, This is
he: others said, He is like him: but
he said, I am he. Therefore said they
unto him, How were thine eyes
opened? He answered and said, A
man that is called Jesus made clay,
and anointed mine eyes, and said
unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam,
and wash: and I went and washed,
and I received sight. Then said they
unto him, Where is he? He said, I
know not.</p>

<p>They brought to the Pharisees him
that aforetime was blind. And it was
the sabbath day when Jesus made the
clay, and opened his eyes. Then
again the Pharisees also asked him
how he had received his sight. He
said unto them, He put clay upon
mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
Therefore said some of the Pharisees,
This man is not of God, because
he keepeth not the sabbath day.
Others said, How can a man that is
a sinner do such miracles? And
there was a division among them.
They say unto the blind man again,
What sayest thou of him, that he hath
opened thine eyes? He said, He is
a prophet. But the Jews did not believe
concerning him, that he had
been blind, and received his sight,
until they called the parents of him
that had received his sight. And they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
asked them, saying, Is this your son,
who ye say was born blind? how then
doth he now see? His parents answered
them and said, We know that
this is our son, and that he was born
blind: but by what means he now
seeth, we know not; or who hath
opened his eyes, we know not: he is
of age; ask him: he shall speak for
himself.</p>

<p>These words spake his parents, because
they feared the Jews: for the
Jews had agreed already, that if any
man did confess that he was Christ,
he should be put out of the synagogue.
Therefore said his parents, He is of
age; ask him. Then again called they
the man that was blind, and said unto
him, Give God the praise: we know
that this man is a sinner. He answered
and said, Whether he be a
sinner or no, I know not: one thing
I know, that, whereas I was blind,
now I see. Then said they to him
again, What did he to thee? how
opened he thine eyes? He answered
them, I have told you already, and
ye did not hear: wherefore would ye
hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?
Then they reviled him, and
said, Thou art his disciple; but we are
Moses' disciples. We know that God
spake unto Moses: as for this fellow,
we know not from whence he is. The
man answered and said unto them,
Why herein is a marvellous thing,
that ye know not from whence he is,
and yet he hath opened mine eyes.
Now we know that God heareth not
sinners: but if any man be a worshipper
of God, and doeth his will,
him he heareth. Since the world began
was it not heard that any man
opened the eyes of one that was born
blind. If this man were not of God,
he could do nothing. They answered
and said unto him, Thou wast altogether
born in sins, and dost thou
teach us? And they cast him out.
Jesus heard that they had cast him
out; and when he had found him, he
said unto him, Dost thou believe on
the Son of God? He answered and
said, Who is he, Lord, that I might
believe on him? And Jesus said
unto him, Thou hast both seen him,
and it is he that talketh with thee.
And he said, Lord, I believe. And
he worshipped him.</p>

<small>THE GOOD SHEPHERD</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 10</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>VERILY, verily, I say unto
you, He that entereth not by
the door into the sheepfold,
but climbeth up some other way, the
same is a thief and a robber. But he
that entereth in by the door is the
shepherd of the sheep. To him the
porter openeth; and the sheep hear
his voice: and he calleth his own sheep
by name, and leadeth them out. And
when he putteth forth his own sheep,
he goeth before them, and the sheep
follow him: for they know his voice.
And a stranger will they not follow,
but will flee from him: for they know
not the voice of strangers. This parable
spake Jesus unto them: but
they understood not what things they
were which he spake unto them.
Then said Jesus unto them again,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am
the door of the sheep. All that ever
came before me are thieves and robbers:
but the sheep did not hear them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
I am the door: by me if any man enter
in, he shall be saved, and shall
go in and out, and find pasture. The
thief cometh not, but for to steal, and
to kill, and to destroy: I am come
that they might have life, and that
they might have it more abundantly.
I am the good shepherd: the good
shepherd giveth his life for the
sheep. But he that is an hireling,
and not the shepherd, whose own the
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming,
and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and
the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth
the sheep. The hireling fleeth,
because he is an hireling, and careth
not for the sheep. I am the good
shepherd, and know my sheep, and
am known of mine. As the Father
knoweth me, even so know I the Father:
and I lay down my life for the
sheep. And other sheep I have,
which are not of this fold: them also
I must bring, and they shall hear my
voice; and there shall be one fold,
and one shepherd. Therefore doth my
Father love me, because I lay down
my life, that I might take it again.
No man taketh it from me, but I lay
it down of myself. I have power to
lay it down, and I have power to take
it again. This commandment have
I received of my Father.</div>

<p>There was a division therefore
again among the Jews for these sayings.</p>

<p>And it was at Jerusalem the feast
of the dedication, and it was winter.
And Jesus walked in the temple in
Solomon's porch. Then came the
Jews round about him, and said unto
him, How long dost thou make us to
doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us
plainly. Jesus answered them, I told
you, and ye believed not: the works
that I do in my Father's name, they
bear witness of me. But ye believe
not, because ye are not of my sheep,
as I said unto you. My sheep hear
my voice, and I know them, and they
follow me: and I give unto them eternal
life; and they shall never perish,
neither shall any man pluck them out
of my hand. My Father, which gave
them me, is greater than all; and no
man is able to pluck them out of my
Father's hand. I and my Father are
one. Then the Jews took up stones
again to stone him. Jesus answered
them, Many good works have I
shewed you from my Father; for
which of those works do ye stone me?
The Jews answered him, saying, For
a good work we stone thee not; but
for blasphemy; and because that
thou, being a man, makest thyself
God. Jesus answered them, Is it not
written in your law, I said, Ye are
gods? If he called them gods, unto
whom the word of God came, and
the scripture cannot be broken; say
ye of him, whom the Father hath
sanctified, and sent into the world,
Thou blasphemest; because I said, I
am the Son of God? If I do not the
works of my Father, believe me not.
But if I do, though ye believe not me,
believe the works: that ye may know,
and believe, that the Father is in me,
and I in him.</p>

<p>Therefore they sought again to
take him: but he escaped out of their
hand, and went away again beyond
Jordan into the place where John at
first baptized; and there he abode.
And many resorted unto him, and
said, John did no miracle: but all
things that John spake of this man
were true. And many believed on
him there.</p>

<small>THE PARABLE OF THE WEDDING
SUPPER</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 14</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, as he went
into the house of one of the
chief Pharisees to eat bread
on the sabbath day, that they watched
him. And, behold, there was a certain
man before him which had the
dropsy. And Jesus answering spake
unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,
Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath
day? And they held their peace.
And he took him, and healed him, and
let him go; and answered them, saying,
Which of you shall have an ass
or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not
straightway pull him out on the sabbath
day? And they could not answer
him again to these things.</div>

<p>And he put forth a parable to those
which were bidden, when he marked
how they chose out the chief rooms;
saying unto them, When thou art bidden
of any man to a wedding, sit not
down in the highest room; lest a more
honourable man than thou be bidden
of him; and he that bade thee and
him come and say to thee, Give this
man place; and thou begin with shame
to take the lowest room. But when
thou art bidden, go and sit down in
the lowest room; that when he that
bade thee cometh, he may say unto
thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt
thou have worship in the presence of
them that sit at meat with thee. For
whosoever exalteth himself shall be
abased; and he that humbleth himself
shall be exalted.</p>

<p>Then said he also to him that bade
him, When thou makest a dinner or a
supper, call not thy friends, nor thy
brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor
thy rich neighbours; lest they also
bid thee again, and a recompence be
made thee. But when thou makest
a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
lame, the blind: and thou shalt be
blessed; for they cannot recompense
thee: for thou shalt be recompensed
at the resurrection of the just.</p>

<p>And when one of them that sat at
meat with him heard these things, he
said unto him, Blessed is he that shall
eat bread in the kingdom of God.
Then said he unto him, A certain man
made a great supper, and bade many:
and sent his servant at supper time
to say to them that were bidden,
Come; for all things are now ready.
And they all with one consent began
to make excuse. The first said unto
him, I have bought a piece of ground,
and I must needs go and see it: I pray
thee have me excused. And another
said, I have bought five yoke of oxen,
and I go to prove them: I pray thee
have me excused. And another said,
I have married a wife, and therefore
I cannot come. So that servant came,
and shewed his lord these things.
Then the master of the house being
angry said to his servant, Go out
quickly into the streets and lanes of
the city, and bring in hither the poor,
and the maimed, and the halt, and
the blind. And the servant said,
Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,
and yet there is room. And
the lord said unto the servant, Go out
into the highways and hedges, and
compel them to come in, that my
house may be filled. For I say unto
you, That none of those men which
were bidden shall taste of my supper.</p>

<small>THE LOST SHEEP, THE LOST COIN,
AND THE PRODIGAL SON</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 15</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THEN drew near unto him all
the publicans and sinners for
to hear him. And the Pharisees
and scribes murmured, saying,
This man receiveth sinners, and eateth
with them.</div>

<p>And he spake this parable unto
them, saying, What man of you, having
an hundred sheep, if he lose one
of them, doth not leave the ninety
and nine in the wilderness, and go
after that which is lost, until he find
it? And when he hath found it, he
layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
And when he cometh home, he calleth
together his friends and neighbours,
saying unto them, Rejoice with me;
for I have found my sheep which was
lost. I say unto you, that likewise joy
shall be in heaven over one sinner
that repenteth, more than over ninety
and nine just persons, which need no
repentance. Either what woman
having ten pieces of silver, if she lose
one piece, doth not light a candle, and
sweep the house, and seek diligently
till she find it? And when she hath
found it, she calleth her friends and
her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice
with me; for I have found the
piece which I had lost. Likewise, I
say unto you, there is joy in the presence
of the angels of God over one
sinner that repenteth.</p>

<p>And he said, A certain man had
two sons: and the younger of them
said to his father, Father, give me
the portion of goods that falleth to
me. And he divided unto them his
living. And not many days after the
younger son gathered all together,
and took his journey into a far country,
and there wasted his substance
with riotous living. And when he
had spent all, there arose a mighty
famine in that land; and he began to
be in want. And he went and joined
himself to a citizen of that country;
and he sent him into his fields to feed
swine. And he would fain have filled
his belly with the husks that the swine
did eat: and no man gave unto him.
And when he came to himself, he
said, How many hired servants of my
father's have bread enough and to
spare, and I perish with hunger! I
will arise and go to my father, and
will say unto him, Father, I have
sinned against heaven, and before
thee, and am no more worthy to be
called thy son: make me as one of
thy hired servants. And he arose,
and came to his father. But when
he was yet a great way off, his father
saw him, and had compassion, and
ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed
him. And the son said unto him, Father,
I have sinned against heaven,
and in thy sight, and am no more
worthy to be called thy son. But the
father said to his servants, Bring
forth the best robe, and put it on him;
and put a ring on his hand, and shoes
on his feet: and bring hither the
fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,
and be merry: for this my son was
dead, and is alive again; he was lost,
and is found. And they began to be
merry.</p>

<p>Now his elder son was in the field:
and as he came and drew nigh to the
house, he heard musick and dancing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
And he called one of the servants,
and asked what these things meant.
And he said unto him, Thy brother
is come; and thy father hath killed
the fatted calf, because he hath received
him safe and sound. And he
was angry, and would not go in:
therefore came his father out, and intreated
him. And he answering said
to his father, Lo, these many years
do I serve thee, neither transgressed
I at any time thy commandment: and
yet thou never gavest me a kid, that
I might make merry with my friends:
but as soon as this thy son was come,
which hath devoured thy living with
harlots, thou hast killed for him the
fatted calf. And he said unto him,
Son, thou art ever with me, and all
that I have is thine. It was meet that
we should make merry, and be glad:
for this thy brother was dead, and is
alive again; and was lost, and is
found.</p>

<small>THE UNJUST STEWARD, THE RICH
MAN, AND LAZARUS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 16</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND he said also unto his disciples,
There was a certain rich
man, which had a steward;
and the same was accused unto him
that he had wasted his goods. And
he called him, and said unto him,
How is it that I hear this of thee? give
an account of thy stewardship; for
thou mayest be no longer steward.
Then the steward said within himself,
What shall I do? for my lord taketh
away from me the stewardship: I
cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. I
am resolved what to do, that, when
I am put out of the stewardship, they
may receive me into their houses. So
he called every one of his lord's
debtors unto him, and said unto the
first, How much owest thou unto my
lord? And he said, An hundred measures
of oil. And he said unto him,
Take thy bill, and sit down quickly,
and write fifty. Then said he to another,
And how much owest thou?
And he said, An hundred measures
of wheat. And he said unto him,
Take thy bill, and write fourscore.
And the lord commended the unjust
steward, because he had done wisely:
for the children of this world are in
their generation wiser than the children
of light. And I say unto you,
Make to yourselves friends of the
mammon of unrighteousness; that,
when ye fail, they may receive you
into everlasting habitations. He that
is faithful in that which is least is
faithful also in much: and he that is
unjust in the least is unjust also in
much. If therefore ye have not been
faithful in the unrighteous mammon,
who will commit to your trust the
true riches? And if ye have not been
faithful in that which is another
man's, who shall give you that which
is your own? No servant can serve
two masters: for either he will hate
the one, and love the other; or else
he will hold to the one, and despise
the other. Ye cannot serve God and
mammon. And the Pharisees also,
who were covetous, heard all these
things: and they derided him. And
he said unto them, Ye are they which
justify yourselves before men; but
God knoweth your hearts: for that
which is highly esteemed among men
is abomination in the sight of God.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a certain rich man,
which was clothed in purple and fine
linen, and fared sumptuously every
day: and there was a certain beggar
named Lazarus, which was laid at his
gate, full of sores, and desiring to be
fed with the crumbs which fell from
the rich man's table: moreover the
dogs came and licked his sores. And
it came to pass, that the beggar died,
and was carried by the angels into
Abraham's bosom: the rich man also
died, and was buried; and in hell he
lift up his eyes, being in torments,
and seeth Abraham afar off, and
Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried
and said, Father Abraham, have
mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that
he may dip the tip of his finger in water,
and cool my tongue; for I am tormented
in this flame. But Abraham
said, Son, remember that thou in thy
lifetime receivedst thy good things,
and likewise Lazarus evil things: but
now he is comforted, and thou art
tormented. And beside all this, between
us and you there is a great gulf
fixed: so that they which would pass
from hence to you cannot; neither
can they pass to us, that would come
from thence. Then he said, I pray
thee therefore, father, that thou
wouldest send him to my father's
house: for I have five brethren; that
he may testify unto them, lest they
also come into this place of torment.
Abraham saith unto him, They have
Moses and the prophets; let them
hear them. And he said, Nay, father
Abraham: but if one went unto them
from the dead, they will repent. And
he said unto him, If they hear not
Moses and the prophets, neither will
they be persuaded, though one rose
from the dead.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, as he went
to Jerusalem, that he passed
through the midst of Samaria
and Galilee. And as he entered into
a certain village, there met him ten
men that were lepers, which stood
afar off: and they lifted up their
voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have
mercy on us. And when he saw them,
he said unto them, Go shew yourselves
unto the priests. And it came
to pass, that, as they went, they were
cleansed. And one of them, when he
saw that he was healed, turned back,
and with a loud voice glorified God,
and fell down on his face at his feet,
giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
And Jesus answering said,
Were there not ten cleansed? but
where are the nine? There are not
found that returned to give glory to
God, save this stranger. And he said
unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy
faith hath made thee whole.</div>

lighteneth out of the one part under
heaven, shineth unto the other part
under heaven; so shall also the Son of
man be in his day. But first must he
suffer many things, and be rejected
of this generation. And as it was in
the days of Noe, so shall it be also
in the days of the Son of man.
They did eat, they drank, they married
wives, they were given in marriage,
until the day that Noe entered
into the ark, and the flood came,
and destroyed them all. Likewise
also as it was in the days of Lot; they
did eat, they drank, they bought, they
sold, they planted, they builded; but
the same day that Lot went out of Sodom
it rained fire and brimstone from
heaven, and destroyed them all.
Even thus shall it be in the day when
the Son of man is revealed. In that
day, he which shall be upon the
housetop, and his stuff in the house,
let him not come down to take it
away: and he that is in the field, let
him likewise not return back. Remember
Lot's wife.</p>

<p>And he spake a parable unto them
to this end, that men ought always to
pray, and not to faint; saying, There
was in a city a judge, which feared
not God, neither regarded man: and
there was a widow in that city; and
she came unto him, saying, Avenge
me of mine adversary. And he would
not for a while: but afterward he said
within himself, Though I fear not
God, nor regard man; yet because
this widow troubleth me, I will
avenge her, lest by her continual coming
she weary me. And the Lord
said, Hear what the unjust judge
saith. And shall not God avenge his
own elect, which cry day and night
unto him, though he bear long with
them? I tell you that he will avenge
them speedily. Nevertheless when
the Son of man cometh, shall he find
faith on the earth?</p>

<p>And he spake this parable unto
certain which trusted in themselves
that they were righteous, and despised
others: two men went up into
the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee,
and the other a publican. The
Pharisee stood and prayed thus with
himself, God, I thank thee, that I am
not as other men are, extortioners,
unjust, adulterers, or even as this
publican. I fast twice in the week,
I give tithes of all that I possess.
And the publican, standing afar off,
would not lift up so much as his eyes
unto heaven, but smote upon his
breast, saying, God be merciful to me
a sinner. I tell you, this man went
down to his house justified rather
than the other: for every one that exalteth
himself shall be abased; and
he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>

<small>JESUS RAISES LAZARUS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 11</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW a certain man was sick,
named Lazarus, of Bethany,
the town of Mary and her
sister Martha. (It was that Mary
which anointed the Lord with ointment,
and wiped his feet with her
hair, whose brother Lazarus was
sick.) Therefore his sisters sent
unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he
whom thou lovest is sick. When Jesus
heard that, he said, This sickness
is not unto death, but for the glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
of God, that the Son of God might be
glorified thereby. Now Jesus loved
Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
When he had heard therefore that
he was sick, he abode two days still
in the same place where he was.
Then after that saith he to his disciples,
Let us go into Judæa again.
His disciples say unto him, Master,
the Jews of late sought to stone thee;
and goest thou thither again? Jesus
answered, Are there not twelve hours
in the day? If any man walk in the
day, he stumbleth not, because he
seeth the light of this world. But if
a man walk in the night, he stumbleth,
because there is no light in
him. These things said he: and after
that he saith unto them, Our friend
Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I
may awake him out of sleep. Then
said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep,
he shall do well. Howbeit Jesus
spake of his death: but they thought
that he had spoken of taking of rest
in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them
plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am
glad for your sakes that I was not
there, to the intent ye may believe;
nevertheless let us go unto him.
Then said Thomas, which is called
Didymus, unto his fellow-disciples,
Let us also go, that we may die with
him. Then when Jesus came, he
found that he had lain in the grave
four days already.</div>

<p>Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem,
about fifteen furlongs off: and
many of the Jews came to Martha
and Mary, to comfort them concerning
their brother. Then Martha, as
soon as she heard that Jesus was coming,
went and met him: but Mary sat
still in the house. Then said Martha
unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been
here, my brother had not died. But
I know, that even now, whatsoever
thou wilt ask of God, God will give
it thee. Jesus saith unto her, Thy
brother shall rise again. Martha
saith unto him, I know that he shall
rise again in the resurrection at the
last day. Jesus said unto her, I am
the resurrection, and the life: he that
believeth in me, though he were dead,
yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth
and believeth in me shall never
die. Believest thou this? She saith
unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that
thou art the Christ, the Son of God,
which should come into the world.
And when she had so said, she went
her way, and called Mary her sister
secretly, saying, The Master is come,
and calleth for thee. As soon as she
heard that, she arose quickly, and
came unto him.</p>

<p>Now Jesus was not yet come into
the town, but was in that place where
Martha met him. The Jews then
which were with her in the house,
and comforted her, when they saw
Mary, that she rose up hastily and
went out, followed her, saying, She
goeth unto the grave to weep there.
Then when Mary was come where Jesus
was, and saw him, she fell down
at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if
thou hadst been here, my brother had
not died. When Jesus therefore saw
her weeping, and the Jews also weeping
which came with her, he groaned
in the spirit, and was troubled, and
said, Where have ye laid him? They
said unto him, Lord, come and see.
Jesus wept. Then said the Jews, Behold
how he loved him! And some of
them said, Could not this man, which
opened the eyes of the blind, have
caused that even this man should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
have died? Jesus therefore again
groaning in himself cometh to the
grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay
upon it. Jesus said, Take ye away
the stone. Martha, the sister of him
that was dead, saith unto him, Lord,
by this time he stinketh: for he hath
been dead four days. Jesus saith
unto her, Said I not unto thee, that,
if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest
see the glory of God? Then they
took away the stone from the place
where the dead was laid. And Jesus
lifted up his eyes, and said, Father,
I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
And I knew that thou hearest me always:
but because of the people
which stand by I said it, that they may
believe that thou hast sent me. And
when he thus had spoken, he cried
with a loud voice, Lazarus, come
forth.</p>

<p>And he that was dead came forth,
bound hand and foot with graveclothes:
and his face was bound about
with a napkin. Jesus saith unto
them, Loose him, and let him go.</p>

<p>Then many of the Jews which
came to Mary, and had seen the
things which Jesus did, believed on
him. But some of them went their
ways to the Pharisees, and told them
what things Jesus had done. Then
gathered the chief priests and the
Pharisees a council, and said, What
do we? for this man doeth many miracles.
If we let him thus alone, all
men will believe on him: and the Romans
shall come and take away both
our place and nation. And one of
them, named Caiaphas, being the
high priest that same year, said unto
them, Ye know nothing at all, nor
consider that it is expedient for us,
that one man should die for the people,
and that the whole nation perish
not. And this spake he not of himself:
but being high priest that year,
he prophesied that Jesus should die
for that nation; and not for that nation
only, but that also he should
gather together in one the children
of God that were scattered abroad.
Then from that day forth they took
counsel together for to put him to
death. Jesus therefore walked no
more openly among the Jews; but
went thence unto a country near to
the wilderness, into a city called
Ephraim, and there continued with
his disciples. And the Jews' passover
was nigh at hand: and many
went out of the country up to Jerusalem
before the passover, to purify
themselves. Then sought they for
Jesus, and spake among themselves,
as they stood in the temple, What
think ye, that he will not come to the
feast? Now both the chief priests
and the Pharisees had given a commandment,
that, if any man knew
where he were, he should shew it,
that they might take him.</p>

<small>JESUS BLESSES THE CHILDREN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Mark 10</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND they brought young children
to Jesus, that he should
touch them: and his disciples
rebuked those that brought them.
But when Jesus saw it, he was much
displeased, and said unto them, Suffer
the little children to come unto
me, and forbid them not: for of such
is the kingdom of God. Verily I say
unto you, Whosoever shall not receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
the kingdom of God as a little
child, he shall not enter therein. And
he took them up in his arms, put his
hands upon them, and blessed them.</div>

<p>And when he was gone forth into
the way, there came one running, and
kneeled to him, and asked him, Good
Master, what shall I do that I may
inherit eternal life? And Jesus said
unto him, Why callest thou me good?
there is none good but one, that is,
God. Thou knowest the commandments,
Do not commit adultery, Do
not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear
false witness, Defraud not, Honour
thy father and mother. And he answered
and said unto him, Master,
all these have I observed from my
youth. Then Jesus beholding him
loved him, and said unto him, One
thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell
whatsoever thou hast, and give to the
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
heaven: and come, take up the cross,
and follow me. And he was sad at
that saying, and went away grieved:
for he had great possessions.</p>

<p>And Jesus looked round about, and
saith unto his disciples, How hardly
shall they that have riches enter into
the kingdom of God! And the disciples
were astonished at his words.
But Jesus answereth again, and saith
unto them, Children, how hard is it
for them that trust in riches to enter
into the kingdom of God! It is easier
for a camel to go through the eye of
a needle, than for a rich man to enter
into the kingdom of God. And they
were astonished out of measure, saying
among themselves, Who then can
be saved? And Jesus looking upon
them saith, With men it is impossible,
but not with God: for with God
all things are possible.</p>

<p>Then Peter began to say unto him,
Lo, we have left all, and have followed
thee. And Jesus answered
and said, Verily I say unto you,
There is no man that hath left house,
or brethren, or sisters, or father, or
mother, or wife, or children, or lands,
for my sake, and the gospel's, but he
shall receive an hundredfold now in
this time, houses, and brethren, and
sisters, and mothers, and children,
and lands, with persecutions; and in
the world to come eternal life. But
many that are first shall be last; and
the last first.</p>

<small>THE LABOURERS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 20</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>JESUS said, For the kingdom
of heaven is like unto a man
that is an householder, which
went out early in the morning to
hire labourers into his vineyard.
And when he had agreed with the
labourers for a penny a day, he sent
them into his vineyard. And he
went out about the third hour, and
saw others standing idle in the
marketplace, and said unto them;
Go ye also into the vineyard, and
whatsoever is right I will give you.
And they went their way. Again
he went out about the sixth and
ninth hour, and did likewise. And
about the eleventh hour he went
out, and found others standing idle,
and saith unto them, Why stand ye
here all the day idle? They say unto
him, Because no man hath hired us.
He saith unto them, Go ye also into
the vineyard; and whatsoever is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
right, that shall ye receive. So when
even was come, the lord of the vineyard
saith unto his steward, Call the
labourers, and give them their hire,
beginning from the last unto the
first. And when they came that were
hired about the eleventh hour, they
received every man a penny. But
when the first came, they supposed
that they should have received more;
and they likewise received every man
a penny. And when they had received
it, they murmured against the
goodman of the house, saying, These
last have wrought but one hour, and
thou hast made them equal unto us,
which have borne the burden and
heat of the day. But he answered
one of them, and said, Friend, I do
thee no wrong: didst not thou agree
with me for a penny? Take that
thine is, and go thy way: I will give
unto this last, even as unto thee. Is
it not lawful for me to do what I will
with mine own? Is thine eye evil,
because I am good? So the last shall
be first, and the first last: for many
be called, but few chosen.</div>

<h2>BOOK III&mdash;THE LAST DAYS OF JESUS</h2>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_52_2" id="CHAPTER_52_2">CHAPTER 52</a><br />

<small>JESUS GOES UP TO JERUSALEM</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="150" height="173" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">AND they were in
the way going up
to Jerusalem; and
Jesus went before
them: and they
were amazed; and
as they followed,
they were afraid.
And he took
again the twelve, and began to tell
them what things should happen unto
him, saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem;
and the Son of man shall
be delivered unto the chief priests,
and unto the scribes; and they shall
condemn him to death, and shall deliver
him to the Gentiles: and they
shall mock him, and shall scourge
him, and shall spit upon him, and
shall kill him: and the third day he
shall rise again. And James and
John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto
him, saying, Master, we would that
thou shouldest do for us whatsoever
we shall desire. And he said unto
them, What would ye that I should
do for you? They said unto him,
Grant unto us that we may sit, one on
thy right hand, and the other on thy
left hand, in thy glory. But Jesus
said unto them, Ye know not what ye
ask: can ye drink of the cup that I
drink of? and be baptized with the
baptism that I am baptized with? And
they said unto him, We can. And
Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed
drink of the cup that I drink of; and
with the baptism that I am baptized
withal shall ye be baptized: but to sit
on my right hand and on my left
hand is not mine to give; but it shall
be given to them for whom it is prepared.
And when the ten heard it,
they began to be much displeased
with James and John. But Jesus
called them to him, and saith unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
them, Ye know that they which are
accounted to rule over the Gentiles
exercise lordship over them; and
their great ones exercise authority
upon them. But so shall it not be
among you: but whosoever will be
great among you, shall be your minister:
and whosoever of you will be
the chiefest, shall be servant of all.
For even the Son of man came not
to be ministered unto, but to minister,
and to give his life a ransom for
many. And they came to Jericho:
and as he went out of Jericho with
his disciples and a great number of
people, blind Bartimæus, the son of
Timæus, sat by the highway side begging.
And when he heard that it was
Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry
out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David,
have mercy on me. And many
charged him that he should hold his
peace: but he cried the more a great
deal, Thou son of David, have mercy
on me. And Jesus stood still, and
commanded him to be called. And
they call the blind man, saying unto
him, Be of good comfort, rise; he
calleth thee. And he, casting away
his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
And Jesus answered and said unto
him, What wilt thou that I should do
unto thee? The blind man said unto
him, Lord, that I might receive my
sight. And Jesus said unto him, Go
thy way; thy faith hath made thee
whole. And immediately he received
his sight, and followed Jesus in the
way.</div>

<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 19</div>

<p>And behold, there was a man
named Zacchæus, which was the chief
among the publicans, and he was
rich. And he sought to see Jesus who
he was; and could not for the press,
because he was little of stature. And
he ran before, and climbed up into a
sycomore tree to see him: for he was
to pass that way. And when Jesus
came to the place, he looked up, and
saw him, and said unto him, Zacchæus,
make haste, and come down;
for to day I must abide at thy house.
And he made haste, and came down,
and received him joyfully. And
when they saw it, they all murmured,
saying, That he was gone to be guest
with a man that is a sinner. And
Zacchæus stood, and said unto the
Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my
goods I give to the poor; and if I
have taken any thing from any man
by false accusation, I restore him
fourfold. And Jesus said unto him,
This day is salvation come to this
house, forsomuch as he also is a son
of Abraham. For the Son of man is
come to seek and to save that which
was lost.</p>

<p>And when he had thus spoken, he
went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.
And it came to pass, when he was
come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany,
at the mount called the mount
of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
saying, Go ye into the village over
against you; in the which at your entering
ye shall find a colt tied, whereon
yet never man sat: loose him, and
bring him hither. And if any man
ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus
shall ye say unto him, Because the
Lord hath need of him. And they
that were sent went their way, and
found even as he had said unto them.
And as they were loosing the colt, the
owners thereof said unto them, Why
loose ye the colt? And they said, The
Lord hath need of him. And they
brought him to Jesus: and they cast
their garments upon the colt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
they set Jesus thereon. And as he
went, they spread their clothes in the
way. And when he was come nigh,
even now at the descent of the mount
of Olives, the whole multitude of the
disciples began to rejoice and praise
God with a loud voice for all the
mighty works that they had seen;
saying, Blessed be the King that cometh
in the name of the Lord: peace in
heaven, and glory in the highest.
And some of the Pharisees from
among the multitude said unto him,
Master, rebuke thy disciples. And
he answered and said unto them, I
tell you that, if these should hold
their peace, the stones would immediately
cry out.</p>

<p>And when he was come near, he
beheld the city, and wept over it, saying,
If thou hadst known, even thou,
at least in this thy day, the things
which belong unto thy peace! but
now they are hid from thine eyes.
For the days shall come upon thee,
that thine enemies shall cast a trench
about thee, and compass thee round,
and keep thee in on every side, and
shall lay thee even with the ground,
and thy children within thee; and
they shall not leave in thee one stone
upon another; because thou knewest
not the time of thy visitation. These
things understood not his disciples
at the first: but when Jesus was glorified,
then remembered they that these
things were written of him, and that
they had done these things unto him.
The people therefore that was with
him when he called Lazarus out of
his grave, and raised him from the
dead, bare record. For this cause the
people also met him, for that they
heard that he had done this miracle.
The Pharisees therefore said among
themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail
nothing? behold, the world is
gone after him.</p>

<small>THE VOICE FROM HEAVEN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 12</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND there were certain Greeks
among them that came up to
worship at the feast: the same
came therefore to Philip, which was
of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired
him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
Philip cometh and telleth Andrew:
and again Andrew and Philip tell
Jesus. And Jesus answered them,
saying, The hour is come, that the
Son of man should be glorified.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except
a corn of wheat fall into the
ground and die, it abideth alone: but
if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
He that loveth his life shall lose it;
and he that hateth his life in this
world shall keep it unto life eternal.
If any man serve me, let him follow
me; and where I am, there shall also
my servant be: if any man serve me,
him will my Father honour. Now is
my soul troubled; and what shall I
say? Father, save me from this
hour: but for this cause came I unto
this hour. Father, glorify thy name.
Then came there a voice from heaven,
saying, I have both glorified it, and
will glorify it again.</div>

<p>The people therefore, that stood
by, and heard it, said that it thundered:
others said, An angel spake to
him. Jesus answered and said, This
voice came not because of me, but
for your sakes. Now is the judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
of this world: now shall the prince
of this world be cast out. And I, if
I be lifted up from the earth, will
draw all men unto me. This he said,
signifying what death he should die.
The people answered him, We have
heard out of the law that Christ abideth
for ever: and how sayest thou,
The Son of man must be lifted up?
who is this Son of man? Then Jesus
said unto them, Yet a little while is
the light with you. Walk while ye
have the light, lest darkness come
upon you: for he that walketh in
darkness knoweth not whither he
goeth. While ye have light, believe
in the light, that ye may be the children
of light. These things spake
Jesus, and departed, and did hide
himself from them. But though he
had done so many miracles before
them, yet they believed not on him:
that the saying of Esaias the prophet
might be fulfilled, which he spake,
Lord, who hath believed our report?
and to whom hath the arm of the
Lord been revealed?</p>

<p>Nevertheless among the chief rulers
also many believed on him; but
because of the Pharisees they did
not confess him, lest they should be
put out of the synagogue: for they
loved the praise of men more than
the praise of God.</p>

<p>Jesus cried and said, He that believeth
on me, believeth not on me,
but on him that sent me. And he
that seeth me seeth him that sent
me. I am come a light into the
world, that whosoever believeth on
me should not abide in darkness.
And if any man hear my words, and
believe not, I judge him not: for I
came not to judge the world, but to
save the world. He that rejecteth
me, and receiveth not my words, hath
one that judgeth him: the word that
I have spoken, the same shall judge
him in the last day. For I have not
spoken of myself; but the Father
which sent me, he gave me a commandment,
what I should say, and
what I should speak. And I know
that his commandment is life everlasting:
whatsoever I speak therefore,
even as the Father said unto
me, so I speak.</p>

<p>And Jesus went into the temple
of God, and cast out all them
that sold and bought in the temple,
and overthrew the tables of
the moneychangers, and the seats of
them that sold doves, and said unto
them, It is written, My house shall
be called the house of prayer; but ye
have made it a den of thieves. And
the blind and the lame came to him
in the temple; and he healed them.
And when the chief priests and
scribes saw the wonderful things
that he did, and the children crying
in the temple, and saying, Hosanna
to the son of David; they were sore
displeased, and said unto him, Hearest
thou what these say? And Jesus
saith unto them, Yea; have ye never
read, Out of the mouth of babes and
sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</p>

<small>THE BARREN FIG TREE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 21</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND he left them, and went out of
the city into Bethany; and he
lodged there. Now in the
morning as he returned into the city,
he hungered. And when he saw a fig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
tree in the way, he came to it, and
found nothing thereon, but leaves
only, and said unto it, Let no fruit
grow on thee henceforward for ever.
And presently the fig tree withered
away. And when the disciples saw
it, they marvelled, saying, How soon
is the fig tree withered away! Jesus
answered and said unto them, Verily
I say unto you, If ye have faith, and
doubt not, ye shall not only do this
which is done to the fig tree, but also
if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be
thou removed, and be thou cast into
the sea; it shall be done. And all
things, whatsoever ye shall ask in
prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</div>

<p>And when he was come into the
temple, the chief priests and the elders
of the people came unto him as
he was teaching, and said, By what
authority doest thou these things?
and who gave thee this authority?
And Jesus answered and said unto
them, I also will ask you one thing,
which if ye tell me, I in like wise will
tell you by what authority I do these
things. The baptism of John, whence
was it? from heaven, or of men?
And they reasoned with themselves,
saying, If we shall say, From heaven;
he will say unto us, Why did ye not
then believe him? But if we shall
say, Of men; we fear the people; for
all hold John as a prophet. And they
answered Jesus, and said, We cannot
tell.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, Neither
tell I you by what authority I do these
things. But what think ye? A certain
man had two sons; and he came
to the first, and said, Son, go work
to day in my vineyard. He answered
and said, I will not: but afterward
he repented, and went. And he came
to the second, and said likewise. And
he answered and said, I go, sir: and
went not. Whether of them twain
did the will of his father? They say
unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto
them, Verily I say unto you, That the
publicans and the harlots go into the
kingdom of God before you. For
John came unto you in the way of
righteousness, and ye believed him
not: but the publicans and the harlots
believed him: and ye, when ye had
seen it, repented not afterward, that
ye might believe him.</p>

<p>Hear another parable: There was
a certain householder, which planted
a vineyard, and hedged it round
about, and digged a winepress in it,
and built a tower, and let it out to
husbandmen, and went into a far
country: and when the time of the
fruit drew near, he sent his servants
to the husbandmen, that they might
receive the fruits of it. And the husbandmen
took his servants, and beat
one, and killed another, and stoned
another. Again, he sent other servants
more than the first: and they
did unto them likewise. But last of
all he sent unto them his son, saying,
They will reverence my son. But
when the husbandmen saw the son,
they said among themselves, This is
the heir; come, let us kill him, and let
us seize on his inheritance. And they
caught him, and cast him out of the
vineyard, and slew him. When the
lord therefore of the vineyard cometh,
what will he do unto those husbandmen?
They say unto him, He
will miserably destroy those wicked
men, and will let out his vineyard
unto other husbandmen, which shall
render him the fruits in their seasons.</p>

<p>Jesus saith unto them, Did ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
never read in the scriptures, The
stone which the builders rejected,
the same is become the head of the
corner: this is the Lord's doing, and
it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore
say I unto you, The kingdom of
God shall be taken from you, and
given to a nation bringing forth the
fruits thereof. And whosoever shall
fall on this stone shall be broken: but
on whomsoever it shall fall, it will
grind him to powder. And when the
chief priests and Pharisees had
heard his parables, they perceived
that he spake of them. But when
they sought to lay hands on him, they
feared the multitude, because they
took him for a prophet.</p>

<small>PARABLE OF THE WEDDING
FEAST</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 22</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Jesus answered and spake
unto them again by parables,
and said, The kingdom of heaven
is like unto a certain king, which
made a marriage for his son, and
sent forth his servants to call them
that were bidden to the wedding: and
they would not come. Again, he sent
forth other servants, saying, Tell
them which are bidden, Behold, I
have prepared my dinner: my oxen
and my fatlings are killed, and all
things are ready: come unto the marriage.
But they made light of it, and
went their ways, one to his farm,
another to his merchandise: and the
remnant took his servants, and entreated
them spitefully, and slew
them. But when the king heard
thereof, he was wroth: and he sent
forth his armies, and destroyed those
murderers, and burned up their city.
Then saith he to his servants, The
wedding is ready, but they which
were bidden were not worthy. Go
ye therefore into the highways, and
as many as ye shall find, bid to the
marriage. So those servants went
out into the highways, and gathered
together all as many as they found,
both bad and good: and the wedding
was furnished with guests. And
when the king came in to see the
guests, he saw there a man which had
not on a wedding garment: and he
saith unto him, Friend, how camest
thou in hither not having a wedding
garment? And he was speechless.
Then said the king to the servants,
Bind him hand and foot, and take him
away, and cast him into outer darkness;
there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth. For many are
called, but few are chosen.</div>

<p>Then went the Pharisees, and took
counsel how they might entangle him
in his talk. And they sent out unto
him their disciples with the Herodians,
saying, Master, we know that
thou art true, and teachest the way of
God in truth, neither carest thou for
any man: for thou regardest not the
person of men. Tell us therefore,
What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to
give tribute unto Cæsar, or not? But
Jesus perceived their wickedness,
and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?
Shew me the tribute money.
And they brought unto him a penny.
And he saith unto them, Whose is
this image and superscription? They
say unto him, Cæsar's. Then saith
he unto them, Render therefore unto
Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
and unto God the things that are
God's. When they had heard these
words, they marvelled, and left him,
and went their way. But when the
Pharisees had heard that he had put
the Sadducees to silence, they were
gathered together. Then one of them,
which was a lawyer, asked him a
question, tempting him, and saying,
Master, which is the great commandment
in the law? Jesus said unto
him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy mind. This
is the first and great commandment.
And the second is like unto it, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
On these two commandments hang all
the law and the prophets.</p>

<p>While the Pharisees were gathered
together, Jesus asked them, saying,
What think ye of Christ? whose
son is he? They say unto him, The
son of David. He saith unto them,
How then doth David in spirit call
him Lord, saying, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto
my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
till I make thine enemies thy footstool?
If David then call him Lord,
how is he his son? And no man was
able to answer him a word, neither
durst any man from that day forth
ask him any more questions.</p>

<small>THE WIDOW'S MITE</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Mark 12</div>

<p>AND Jesus sat over against the
treasury, and beheld how the
people cast money into the
treasury: and many that were rich
cast in much. And there came a certain
poor widow, and she threw in
two mites, which make a farthing.
And he called unto him his disciples,
and saith unto them, Verily I say unto
you, That this poor widow hath cast
more in, than all they which have
cast into the treasury: for all they
did cast in of their abundance; but
she of her want did cast in all that
she had, even all her living.</p>

<small>THE DESTRUCTION OF THE
TEMPLE AND THE END
OF THE WORLD</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND Jesus went out, and departed
from the temple: and
his disciples came to him for
to shew him the buildings of the temple.
And Jesus said unto them, See
ye not all these things? verily I say
unto you, There shall not be left here
one stone upon another, that shall not
be thrown down.</div>

<p>And as he sat upon the mount of
Olives, the disciples came unto him
privately, saying, Tell us, when shall
these things be? and what shall be
the sign of thy coming, and of the
end of the world? And Jesus answered
and said unto them, Take
heed that no man deceive you. For
many shall come in my name, saying,
I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
And ye shall hear of wars and rumours
of wars: see that ye be not
troubled: for all these things must
come to pass, but the end is not yet.
For nation shall rise against nation,
and kingdom against kingdom: and
there shall be famines, and pestilences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
and earthquakes, in divers
places. All these are the beginning
of sorrows. Then shall they deliver
you up to be afflicted, and shall kill
you: and ye shall be hated of all nations
for my name's sake. And then
shall many be offended, and shall betray
one another, and shall hate one
another. And many false prophets
shall rise, and shall deceive many.
And because iniquity shall abound,
the love of many shall wax cold. But
he that shall endure unto the end, the
same shall be saved. And this gospel
of the kingdom shall be preached in
all the world for a witness unto all nations;
and then shall the end come.</p>

<p>But of that day and hour knoweth
no man, no, not the angels of heaven,
but my Father only. But as the days
of Noe were, so shall also the coming
of the Son of man be. For as in the
days that were before the flood they
were eating and drinking, marrying
and giving in marriage, until the day
that Noe entered into the ark, and
knew not until the flood came, and
took them all away; so shall also the
coming of the Son of man be. Then
shall two be in the field; the one shall
be taken, and the other left. Two
women shall be grinding at the mill;
the one shall be taken, and the other
left. Watch therefore: for ye know
not what hour your Lord doth come.
But know this, that if the goodman
of the house had known in what
watch the thief would come, he would
have watched, and would not have
suffered his house to be broken up.
Therefore be ye also ready: for in
such an hour as ye think not the Son
of man cometh. Who then is a faithful
and wise servant, whom his lord
hath made ruler over his household,
to give them meat in due season?
Blessed is that servant, whom his
lord when he cometh shall find so
doing. Verily I say unto you, That
he shall make him ruler over all his
goods. But and if that evil servant
shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth
his coming; and shall begin to
smite his fellowservants, and to eat
and drink with the drunken; the lord
of that servant shall come in a day
when he looketh not for him, and in
an hour that he is not aware of, and
shall cut him asunder, and appoint
him his portion with the hypocrites:
there shall be weeping and gnashing
of teeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 25</div>

<p>Then shall the kingdom of heaven
be likened unto ten virgins, which
took their lamps, and went forth to
meet the bridegroom. And five of
them were wise, and five were foolish.
They that were foolish took
their lamps, and took no oil with
them: but the wise took oil in their
vessels with their lamps. While the
bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered
and slept. And at midnight
there was a cry made, Behold, the
bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet
him. Then all those virgins arose,
and trimmed their lamps. And the
foolish said unto the wise, Give us
of your oil; for our lamps are gone
out. But the wise answered, saying,
Not so; lest there be not enough for
us and you: but go ye rather to them
that sell, and buy for yourselves.
And while they went to buy, the
bridegroom came; and they that were
ready went in with him to the marriage:
and the door was shut. Afterward
came also the other virgins,
saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But
he answered and said, Verily I say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
unto you, I know you not. Watch
therefore, for ye know neither the
day nor the hour wherein the Son of
man cometh.</p>

<p>For the kingdom of heaven is as
a man travelling into a far country,
who called his own servants, and delivered
unto them his goods. And
unto one he gave five talents, to another
two, and to another one; to
every man according to his several
ability; and straightway took his
journey. Then he that had received
the five talents went and traded with
the same, and made them other five
talents. And likewise he that had
received two, he also gained other
two. But he that had received one
went and digged in the earth, and hid
his lord's money. After a long time
the lord of those servants cometh, and
reckoneth with them. And so he that
had received five talents came and
brought other five talents, saying,
Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five
talents: behold, I have gained beside
them five talents more. His lord said
unto him, Well done, thou good and
faithful servant: thou hast been
faithful over a few things, I will
make thee ruler over many things:
enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
He also that had received two talents
came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst
unto me two talents: behold, I
have gained two other talents beside
them. His lord said unto him, Well
done, good and faithful servant; thou
hast been faithful over a few things,
I will make thee ruler over many
things: enter thou into the joy of thy
lord. Then he which had received
the one talent came and said, Lord,
I knew thee that thou art an hard
man, reaping where thou hast not
sown, and gathering where thou hast
not strawed: and I was afraid, and
went and hid thy talent in the earth:
lo, there thou hast that is thine. His
lord answered and said unto him,
Thou wicked and slothful servant,
thou knewest that I reap where I
sowed not, and gather where I have
not strawed: thou oughtest therefore
to have put my money to the exchangers,
and then at my coming I
should have received mine own with
usury. Take therefore the talent
from him, and give it unto him which
hath ten talents. For unto every one
that hath shall be given, and he shall
have abundance: but from him that
hath not shall be taken away even
that which he hath. And cast ye the
unprofitable servant into outer darkness:
there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>When the Son of man shall come
in his glory, and all the holy angels
with him, then shall he sit upon the
throne of his glory: and before him
shall be gathered all nations: and he
shall separate them one from another,
as a shepherd divideth his sheep
from the goats: and he shall set
the sheep on his right hand, but the
goats on the left. Then shall the
King say unto them on his right
hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for
you from the foundation of the world:
for I was an hungred, and ye gave
me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave
me drink: I was a stranger, and ye
took me in: naked, and ye clothed
me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I
was in prison, and ye came unto me.
Then shall the righteous answer him,
saying, Lord, when saw we thee an
hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
and gave thee drink? When saw we
thee a stranger, and took thee in?
or naked, and clothed thee? Or when
saw we thee sick, or in prison, and
came unto thee? And the King shall
answer and say unto them, Verily I
say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have
done it unto one of the least of these
my brethren, ye have done it unto
me. Then shall he say also unto
them on the left hand, Depart from
me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,
prepared for the devil and his angels:
for I was an hungred, and ye gave
me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye
gave me no drink: I was a stranger,
and ye took me not in: naked, and ye
clothed me not: sick, and in prison,
and ye visited me not. Then shall
they also answer him, saying, Lord,
when saw we thee an hungred, or
athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or
sick, or in prison, and did not minister
unto thee? Then shall he answer
them, saying, Verily I say unto
you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one
of the least of these, ye did it not
to me. And these shall go away
into everlasting punishment: but the
righteous into life eternal.</p>

<small>THE LAST SUPPER</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 26</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, when Jesus
had finished all these sayings,
he said unto his disciples, Ye
know that after two days is the feast
of the passover, and the Son of man
is betrayed to be crucified. Then assembled
together the chief priests,
and the scribes, and the elders of the
people, unto the palace of the high
priest, who was called Caiaphas, and
consulted that they might take Jesus
by subtilty, and kill him. But they
said, Not on the feast day, lest there
be an uproar among the people.</div>

<p>Now when Jesus was in Bethany,
in the house of Simon the leper, there
came unto him a woman having an
alabaster box of very precious ointment,
and poured it on his head, as
he sat at meat. But when his disciples
saw it, they had indignation,
saying, To what purpose is this
waste? For this ointment might have
been sold for much, and given to the
poor. When Jesus understood it, he
said unto them, Why trouble ye the
woman? for she hath wrought a good
work upon me. For ye have the poor
always with you; but me ye have not
always. For in that she hath poured
this ointment on my body, she did it
for my burial. Verily I say unto
you, Wheresoever this gospel shall
be preached in the whole world, there
shall also this, that this woman hath
done, be told for a memorial of her.</p>

<p>Then one of the twelve, called Judas
Iscariot, went unto the chief
priests, and said unto them, What
will ye give me, and I will deliver
him unto you? And they covenanted
with him for thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time he sought opportunity
to betray him.</p>

<p>Now the first day of the feast of
unleavened bread the disciples came
to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt
thou that we prepare for thee to eat
the passover? And he said, Go into
the city to such a man, and say unto
him, The Master saith, My time is at
hand; I will keep the passover at thy
house with my disciples. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
disciples did as Jesus had appointed
them; and they made ready the passover.
And as they were eating, Jesus
took bread, and blessed it, and brake
it, and gave it to the disciples, and
said, Take, eat; this is my body. And
he took the cup, and gave thanks,
and gave it to them, saying, Drink
ye all of it; for this is my blood of
the new testament, which is shed for
many for the remission of sins. But
I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth
of this fruit of the vine, until
that day when I drink it new with
you in my Father's kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. John 13</div>

<p>Now before the feast of the passover,
when Jesus knew that his hour
was come that he should depart out
of this world unto the Father, having
loved his own which were in the
world, he loved them unto the end.
He riseth from supper, and laid aside
his garments; and took a towel, and
girded himself. After that he poureth
water into a bason, and began to
wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe
them with the towel wherewith he
was girded. Then cometh he to Simon
Peter: and Peter saith unto him,
Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus
answered and said unto him,
What I do thou knowest not now;
but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter
saith unto him, Thou shalt never
wash my feet. Jesus answered him,
If I wash thee not, thou hast no part
with me. Simon Peter saith unto
him, Lord, not my feet only, but also
my hands and my head. Jesus saith
to him, He that is washed needeth
not save to wash his feet, but is clean
every whit: and ye are clean, but not
all. For he knew who should betray
him; therefore said he, Ye are not all
clean. So after he had washed their
feet, and had taken his garments, and
was set down again, he said unto
them, Know ye what I have done to
you? Ye call me Master and Lord:
and ye say well; for so I am. If I
then, your Lord and Master, have
washed your feet; ye also ought to
wash one another's feet. For I have
given you an example, that ye should
do as I have done to you. Verily,
verily, I say unto you, The servant
is not greater than his lord; neither
he that is sent greater than he that
sent him. If ye know these things,
happy are ye if ye do them. I speak
not of you all: I know whom I have
chosen: but that the scripture may be
fulfilled, He that eateth bread with
me hath lifted up his heel against
me. Now I tell you before it come,
that, when it is come to pass, ye may
believe that I am he. Verily, verily,
I say unto you, He that receiveth
whomsoever I send receiveth me;
and he that receiveth me receiveth
him that sent me.</p>

<p>When Jesus had thus said, he was
troubled in spirit, and testified, and
said, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
that one of you shall betray me.
Then the disciples looked one on another,
doubting of whom he spake.
Now there was leaning on Jesus'
bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus
loved. Simon Peter therefore
beckoned to him, that he should ask
who it should be of whom he spake.
He then lying on Jesus' breast saith
unto him, Lord, who is it? Jesus answered,
He it is, to whom I shall give
a sop, when I have dipped it. And
when he had dipped the sop, he gave
it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
And after the sop Satan entered into
him. Then said Jesus unto him, That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
thou doest, do quickly. Now no man
at the table knew for what intent he
spake this unto him. For some of
them thought, because Judas had the
bag, that Jesus had said unto him,
Buy those things that we have need
of against the feast; or, that he should
give something to the poor. He then
having received the sop went immediately
out: and it was night.</p>

<p>Therefore, when he was gone out,
Jesus said, Now is the Son of man
glorified, and God is glorified in him.
Little children, yet a little while I am
with you. Ye shall seek me: and as
I said unto the Jews, Whither I go,
ye cannot come; so now I say to you.
A new commandment I give unto
you, That ye love one another; as I
have loved you, that ye also love one
another. By this shall all men know
that ye are my disciples, if ye have
love one to another.</p>

<p>Simon Peter said unto him, Lord,
whither goest thou? Jesus answered
him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow
me now; but thou shalt follow me
afterwards. Peter said unto him,
Lord, why cannot I follow thee now?
I will lay down my life for thy sake.
Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay
down thy life for my sake? Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall
not crow, till thou hast denied me
thrice.</p>

<small>JESUS COMFORTS HIS DISCIPLES</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 14</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>LET not your heart be troubled:
ye believe in God, believe also
in me. In my Father's house
are many mansions: if it were not
so, I would have told you. I go to
prepare a place for you. And if I
go and prepare a place for you, I will
come again, and receive you unto myself;
that where I am, there ye may
be also. And whither I go ye know,
and the way ye know. Thomas saith
unto him, Lord, we know not whither
thou goest; and how can we know the
way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the
way, the truth, and the life: no man
cometh unto the Father, but by me.
If ye had known me, ye should have
known my Father also: and from
henceforth ye know him, and have
seen him. Philip saith unto him,
Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth
us. Jesus saith unto him, Have
I been so long time with you, and yet
hast thou not known me, Philip? he
that hath seen me hath seen the Father;
and how sayest thou then, Shew
us the Father? Believest thou not
that I am in the Father, and the Father
in me? the words that I speak
unto you I speak not of myself: but
the Father that dwelleth in me, he
doeth the works. Believe me that I
am in the Father, and the Father in
me: or else believe me for the very
works' sake. Verily, verily, I say
unto you, He that believeth on me,
the works that I do shall he do also;
and greater works than these shall
he do; because I go unto my Father.
And whatsoever ye shall ask in my
name, that will I do, that the Father
may be glorified in the Son. If ye
shall ask any thing in my name, I will
do it.</div>

<p>If ye love me, keep my commandments.
And I will pray the Father,
and he shall give you another Comforter,
that he may abide with you
for ever; even the Spirit of truth;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
whom the world cannot receive, because
it seeth him not, neither knoweth
him: but ye know him; for he
dwelleth with you, and shall be in
you. I will not leave you comfortless:
I will come to you. Yet a little
while, and the world seeth me no
more; but ye see me: because I live,
ye shall live also. At that day ye
shall know that I am in my Father,
and ye in me, and I in you. He that
hath my commandments, and keepeth
them, he it is that loveth me: and he
that loveth me shall be loved of my
Father, and I will love him, and will
manifest myself to him. Judas saith
unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is
it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto
us, and not unto the world? Jesus
answered and said unto him, If a man
love me, he will keep my words: and
my Father will love him, and we will
come unto him, and make our abode
with him. He that loveth me not
keepeth not my sayings: and the word
which ye hear is not mine, but the
Father's which sent me. These
things have I spoken unto you, being
yet present with you. But the Comforter,
which is the Holy Ghost,
whom the Father will send in my
name, he shall teach you all things,
and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto
you. Peace I leave with you, my
peace I give unto you: not as the
world giveth, give I unto you. Let
not your heart be troubled, neither
let it be afraid. Ye have heard how
I said unto you, I go away, and come
again unto you. If ye loved me, ye
would rejoice, because I said, I go
unto the Father: for my Father is
greater than I. And now I have told
you before it come to pass, that, when
it is come to pass, ye might believe.
Hereafter I will not talk much with
you: for the prince of this world cometh,
and hath nothing in me. But
that the world may know that I love
the Father; and as the Father gave
me commandment, even so I do.
Arise, let us go hence.</p>

the vine, ye are the branches: He
that abideth in me, and I in him, the
same bringeth forth much fruit: for
without me ye can do nothing. If
a man abide not in me, he is cast
forth as a branch, and is withered;
and men gather them, and cast them
into the fire, and they are burned. If
ye abide in me, and my words abide
in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and
it shall be done unto you. Herein is
my Father glorified, that ye bear
much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.
As the Father hath loved me,
so have I loved you: continue ye in
my love. If ye keep my commandments,
ye shall abide in my love;
even as I have kept my Father's commandments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
and abide in his love.
These things have I spoken unto you,
that my joy might remain in you, and
that your joy might be full.</div>

<p>This is my commandment, That ye
love one another, as I have loved you.
Greater love hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life for his
friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do
whatsoever I command you. Henceforth
I call you not servants; for the
servant knoweth not what his lord
doeth: but I have called you friends;
for all things that I have heard of my
Father I have made known unto you.
Ye have not chosen me, but I have
chosen you, and ordained you, that
ye should go and bring forth fruit,
and that your fruit should remain:
that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
Father in my name, he may give it
you. These things I command you,
that ye love one another. If the
world hate you, ye know that it hated
me before it hated you. If ye were
of the world, the world would love
his own: but because ye are not of
the world, but I have chosen you out
of the world, therefore the world hateth
you. Remember the word that
I said unto you, The servant is not
greater than his lord. If they have
persecuted me, they will also persecute
you; if they have kept my saying,
they will keep your's also. But
all these things will they do unto you
for my name's sake, because they
know not him that sent me. If I had
not come and spoken unto them, they
had not had sin: but now they have
no cloke for their sin. He that hateth
me hateth my Father also. If I had
not done among them the works
which none other man did, they had
not had sin: but now have they both
seen and hated both me and my Father.
But this cometh to pass, that
the word might be fulfilled that is
written in their law, They hated me
without a cause. But when the Comforter
is come, whom I will send unto
you from the Father, even the Spirit
of truth, which proceedeth from the
Father, he shall testify of me: and ye
also shall bear witness, because ye
have been with me from the beginning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. John 16</div>

<p>These things have I spoken unto
you, that ye should not be offended.
They shall put you out of the synagogues:
yea, the time cometh, that
whosoever killeth you will think that
he doeth God service. And these
things will they do unto you, because
they have not known the Father, nor
me. But these things have I told
you, that when the time shall come,
ye may remember that I told you of
them. And these things I said not
unto you at the beginning, because I
was with you. But now I go my way
to him that sent me; and none of you
asketh me, Whither goest thou? But
because I have said these things unto
you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It
is expedient for you that I go away:
for if I go not away, the Comforter
will not come unto you; but if I depart,
I will send him unto you. I
have yet many things to say unto you,
but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit
when he, the Spirit of truth, is
come, he will guide you into all truth:
for he shall not speak of himself; but
whatsoever he shall hear, that shall
he speak: and he will shew you things
to come. He shall glorify me: for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
he shall receive of mine, and shall
shew it unto you. All things that the
Father hath are mine: therefore said
I, that he shall take of mine, and shall
shew it unto you. A little while, and
ye shall not see me: and again, a little
while, and ye shall see me, because I
go to the Father.</p>

<p>Then said some of his disciples
among themselves, What is this that
he saith unto us, A little while, and
ye shall not see me: and again, a little
while, and ye shall see me, because
I go to the Father? They said therefore,
What is this that he saith, A little
while? we cannot tell what he
saith. Now Jesus knew that they
were desirous to ask him, and said
unto them, Do ye enquire among
yourselves of that I said, A little
while, and ye shall not see me: and
again, a little while, and ye shall see
me? Verily, verily, I say unto you,
That ye shall weep and lament, but
the world shall rejoice: and ye shall
be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall
be turned into joy. And in that day
ye shall ask me nothing. Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever
ye shall ask the Father in my name,
he will give it you. Hitherto have ye
asked nothing in my name: ask, and
ye shall receive, that your joy may
be full. These things have I spoken
unto you in proverbs: but the time
cometh, when I shall no more speak
unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew
you plainly of the Father. At that
day ye shall ask in my name: and I
say not unto you, that I will pray the
Father for you: for the Father himself
loveth you, because ye have loved
me, and have believed that I came
out from God. I came forth from the
Father, and am come into the world:
again, I leave the world, and go to the
Father. His disciples said unto him,
Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and
speakest no proverb. Now are we
sure that thou knowest all things,
and needest not that any man should
ask thee: by this we believe that thou
earnest forth from God. Jesus answered
them, Do ye now believe?
Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now
come, that ye shall be scattered,
every man to his own, and shall leave
me alone: and yet I am not alone, because
the Father is with me. These
things I have spoken unto you, that
in me ye might have peace. In the
world ye shall have tribulation: but
be of good cheer; I have overcome
the world.</p>

<small>JESUS PRAYS FOR HIS DISCIPLES</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 17</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THESE words spake Jesus, and
lifted up his eyes to heaven,
and said, Father, the hour is
come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son
also may glorify thee: as thou hast
given him power over all flesh, that
he should give eternal life to as many
as thou hast given him. And this is
life eternal, that they might know
thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom thou hast sent. I have
glorified thee on the earth: I have
finished the work which thou gavest
me to do. And now, O Father, glorify
thou me with thine own self with the
glory which I had with thee before
the world was. I have manifested
thy name unto the men which thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
gavest me out of the world: thine they
were, and thou gavest them me; and
they have kept thy word. Now they
have known that all things whatsoever
thou hast given me are of thee.</div>

<p>For I have given unto them the
words which thou gavest me; and
they have received them, and have
known surely that I came out from
thee, and they have believed that
thou didst send me. I pray for
them: I pray not for the world,
but for them which thou hast given
me; for they are thine. And all
mine are thine, and thine are mine;
and I am glorified in them. And
now I am no more in the world,
but these are in the world, and I come
to thee. Holy Father, keep through
thine own name those whom thou
hast given me, that they may be one,
as we are. While I was with them
in the world, I kept them in thy
name: those that thou gavest me I
have kept, and none of them is lost,
but the son of perdition; that the
scripture might be fulfilled. And
now come I to thee; and these things
I speak in the world, that they might
have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
I have given them thy word; and the
world hath hated them, because they
are not of the world, even as I am not
of the world. I pray not that thou
shouldest take them out of the world,
but that thou shouldest keep them
from the evil. They are not of the
world, even as I am not of the world.
Sanctify them through thy truth: thy
word is truth. As thou hast sent me
into the world, even so have I also
sent them into the world. And for
their sakes I sanctify myself, that
they also might be sanctified through
the truth. Neither pray I for these
alone, but for them also which shall
believe on me through their word;
that they all may be one; as thou, Father,
art in me, and I in thee, that
they also may be one in us: that the
world may believe that thou hast sent
me. And the glory which thou gavest
me I have given them; that they may
be one, even as we are one: I in them,
and thou in me, that they may be
made perfect in one; and that the
world may know that thou hast sent
me, and hast loved them, as thou hast
loved me. Father, I will that they
also, whom thou hast given me, be
with me where I am; that they may
behold my glory, which thou hast
given me: for thou lovedst me before
the foundation of the world. O righteous
Father, the world hath not
known thee: but I have known thee,
and these have known that thou hast
sent me. And I have declared unto
them thy name, and will declare it:
that the love wherewith thou hast
loved me may be in them, and I in
them. And when they had sung an
hymn, they went out into the mount
of Olives. Then saith Jesus unto
them, All ye shall be offended because
of me this night: for it is written,
I will smite the shepherd, and the
sheep of the flock shall be scattered
abroad. But after I am risen again,
I will go before you into Galilee. Peter
answered and said unto him,
Though all men shall be offended because
of thee, yet will I never be
offended. Jesus said unto him, Verily
I say unto thee, That this night,
before the cock crow, thou shalt deny
me thrice. Peter said unto him,
Though I should die with thee, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
will I not deny thee. Likewise also
said all the disciples.</p>

<small>JESUS BETRAYED AND DENIED</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 26</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THEN cometh Jesus with them
unto a place called Gethsemane,
and saith unto the disciples,
Sit ye here, while I go and
pray yonder. And he took with him
Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,
and began to be sorrowful and very
heavy. Then saith he unto them, My
soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
unto death: tarry ye here, and watch
with me. And he went a little farther,
and fell on his face, and prayed,
saying, O my Father, if it be possible,
let this cup pass from me: nevertheless
not as I will, but as thou wilt.
And he cometh unto the disciples,
and findeth them asleep, and saith
unto Peter, What, could ye not watch
with me one hour? Watch and pray,
that ye enter not into temptation: the
spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh
is weak. He went away again the
second time, and prayed, saying, O
my Father, if this cup may not pass
away from me, except I drink it, thy
will be done. And he came and found
them asleep again: for their eyes
were heavy. And he left them, and
went away again, and prayed the
third time, saying the same words.
Then cometh he to his disciples, and
saith unto them, Sleep on now, and
take your rest: behold, the hour is at
hand, and the Son of man is betrayed
into the hands of sinners. Rise, let
us be going: behold, he is at hand
that doth betray me.</div>

<p>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas,
one of the twelve, came, and with him
a great multitude with swords and
staves, from the chief priests and elders
of the people. Now he that betrayed
him gave them a sign, saying,
Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is
he: hold him fast. And forthwith he
came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master;
and kissed him. And Jesus said unto
him, Friend, wherefore art thou
come? Then came they, and laid
hands on Jesus, and took him. And,
behold, one of them which were with
Jesus stretched out his hand, and
drew his sword, and struck a servant
of the high priest's, and smote off his
ear. Then said Jesus unto him, Put
up again thy sword into his place: for
all they that take the sword shall perish
with the sword. Thinkest thou
that I cannot now pray to my Father,
and he shall presently give me more
than twelve legions of angels? But
how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled,
that thus it must be? In that
same hour said Jesus to the multitudes,
Are ye come out as against a
thief with swords and staves for to
take me? I sat daily with you teaching
in the temple, and ye laid no hold
on me. But all this was done, that
the scriptures of the prophets might
be fulfilled. Then all the disciples
forsook him, and fled.</p>

<p>And they that had laid hold on Jesus
led him away to Caiaphas the
high priest, where the scribes and the
elders were assembled. But Peter
followed him afar off unto the high
priest's palace, and went in, and sat
with the servants, to see the end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
Now the chief priests, and elders, and
all the council, sought false witness
against Jesus, to put him to death;
but found none: yea, though many
false witnesses came, yet found they
none. At the last came two false
witnesses, and said, This fellow said,
I am able to destroy the temple of
God, and to build it in three days.
And the high priest arose, and said
unto him, Answerest thou nothing?
what is it which these witness against
thee? But Jesus held his peace.
And the high priest answered and
said unto him, I adjure thee by the
living God, that thou tell us whether
thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said:
nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter
shall ye see the Son of man sitting
on the right hand of power, and
coming in the clouds of heaven.
Then the high priest rent his clothes,
saying, He hath spoken blasphemy;
what further need have we of witnesses?
behold, now ye have heard
his blasphemy. What think ye?
They answered and said, He is guilty
of death. Then did they spit in his
face, and buffeted him; and others
smote him with the palms of their
hands, saying, Prophesy unto us,
thou Christ, Who is he that smote
thee?</p>

<div class="caption">CHRIST CROWNED WITH THORNS, BY VAN DYCK<br />

<span class='location'>IN THE PRADO MUSEUM, MADRID</span></div>
</div>

<p>Now Peter sat without in the palace:
and a damsel came unto him,
saying, Thou also wast with Jesus
of Galilee. But he denied before
them all, saying, I know not what
thou sayest. And when he was gone
out into the porch, another maid saw
him, and said unto them that were
there, This fellow was also with Jesus
of Nazareth. And again he denied
with an oath, I do not know the man.
And after a while came unto him
they that stood by, and said to
Peter, Surely thou also art one of
them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.
Then began he to curse and to swear,
saying, I know not the man. And
immediately the cock crew. And Peter
remembered the word of Jesus,
which said unto him, Before the cock
crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And
he went out, and wept bitterly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 27</div>

<p>When the morning was come, all
the chief priests and elders of the
people took counsel against Jesus to
put him to death: and when they had
bound him, they led him away, and
delivered him to Pontius Pilate the
governor.</p>

<p>Then Judas, which had betrayed
him, when he saw that he was
condemned, repented himself, and
brought again the thirty pieces of
silver to the chief priests and elders,
saying, I have sinned in that I have
betrayed the innocent blood. And
they said, What is that to us? see thou
to that. And he cast down the pieces
of silver in the temple, and departed,
and went and hanged himself. And
the chief priests took the silver
pieces, and said, It is not lawful for
to put them into the treasury, because
it is the price of blood. And they
took counsel, and bought with them
the potter's field, to bury strangers
in. Wherefore that field was called
the field of blood unto this day. Then
was fulfilled that which was spoken
by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And
they took the thirty pieces of silver,
the price of him that was
valued, whom they of the children
of Israel did value; and gave them
for the potter's field, as the Lord
appointed me.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_63_2" id="CHAPTER_63_2">CHAPTER 63</a><br />

<small>JESUS CONDEMNED AND
CRUCIFIED</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. John 18</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THEN led they Jesus from
Caiaphas unto the hall of
judgment: and it was early;
and they themselves went not into the
judgment hall, lest they should be defiled;
but that they might eat the
passover. Pilate then went out unto
them, and said, What accusation
bring ye against this man? They
answered and said unto him, If he
were not a malefactor, we would not
have delivered him up unto thee.
Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye
him, and judge him according to your
law. The Jews therefore said unto
him, It is not lawful for us to put any
man to death: that the saying of Jesus
might be fulfilled, which he spake,
signifying what death he should die.
Then Pilate entered into the judgment
hall again, and called Jesus,
and said unto him, Art thou the King
of the Jews? Jesus answered him,
Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or
did others tell it thee of me? Pilate
answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own
nation and the chief priests have delivered
thee unto me: what hast thou
done? Jesus answered, My kingdom
is not of this world: if my kingdom
were of this world, then would my
servants fight, that I should not be
delivered to the Jews: but now is my
kingdom not from hence. Pilate
therefore said unto him, Art thou a
king then? Jesus answered, Thou
sayest that I am a king. To this end
was I born, and for this cause came I
into the world, that I should bear witness
unto the truth. Every one that
is of the truth heareth my voice. Pilate
saith unto him, What is truth?
And when he had said this, he went
out again unto the Jews, and saith
unto them, I find in him no fault at
all. And they were the more fierce,
saying, He stirreth up the people,
teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning
from Galilee to this place.
When Pilate heard of Galilee, he
asked whether the man were a Galilæan.
And as soon as he knew that
he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction,
he sent him to Herod, who himself
also was at Jerusalem at that
time.</div>

<p>And when Herod saw Jesus, he
was exceeding glad: for he was desirous
to see him of a long season, because
he had heard many things of
him; and he hoped to have seen some
miracle done by him.</p>

<p>Then he questioned with him in
many words; but he answered him
nothing. And the chief priests and
scribes stood and vehemently accused
him. And Herod with his men of war
set him at nought, and mocked him,
and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe,
and sent him again to Pilate. And
the same day Pilate and Herod were
made friends together: for before
they were at enmity between themselves.</p>
<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 27</div>

<p>And Pilate, when he had called together
the chief priests and the rulers
and the people, said unto them, Ye
have brought this man unto me, as
one that perverteth the people: and,
behold, I, having examined him before
you, have found no fault in this
man touching those things whereof ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
accuse him: no, nor yet Herod: for I
sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy
of death is done unto him. I will
therefore chastise him, and release
him. Now at that feast the governor
was wont to release unto the people
a prisoner, whom they would. And
they had then a notable prisoner,
called Barabbas. Therefore when
they were gathered together, Pilate
said unto them, Whom will ye that I
release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus
which is called Christ? For he
knew that for envy they had delivered
him.</p>

<div class="caption">THE DESCENT FROM THE CROSS, BY RUBENS<br />
<span class='location'>IN THE CATHEDRAL, ANTWERP</span></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 23</div>

<p>When he was set down on the judgment
seat, his wife sent unto him,
saying, Have thou nothing to do with
that just man: for I have suffered
many things this day in a dream because
of him. But the chief priests
and elders persuaded the multitude
that they should ask Barabbas, and
destroy Jesus. The governor answered
and said unto them, Whether
of the twain will ye that I release unto
you? They said, Barabbas. Pilate
saith unto them, What shall I do then
with Jesus which is called Christ?
They all say unto him, Let him be
crucified. And the governor said,
Why, what evil hath he done? But
they cried out the more, saying, Let
him be crucified. When Pilate saw
that he could prevail nothing, but that
rather a tumult was made, he took
water, and washed his hands before
the multitude, saying, I am innocent
of the blood of this just person: see
ye to it. Then answered all the people,
and said, His blood be on us, and
on our children. Then Pilate therefore
took Jesus, and scourged him.
And the soldiers platted a crown of
thorns, and put it on his head, and
they put on him a purple robe, and
said, Hail, King of the Jews! and
they smote him with their hands. Pilate
therefore went forth again, and
saith unto them, Behold, I bring him
forth to you, that ye may know that I
find no fault in him. Then came Jesus
forth, wearing the crown of
thorns, and the purple robe. And
Pilate saith unto them, Behold the
man! When the chief priests therefore
and officers saw him, they cried
out, saying, Crucify him, crucify
him. Pilate saith unto them, Take
ye him, and crucify him: for I find
no fault in him. The Jews answered
him, We have a law, and by our law
he ought to die, because he made himself
the Son of God.</p>

<p>When Pilate therefore heard that
saying, he was the more afraid; and
went again into the judgment hall,
and saith unto Jesus, Whence art
thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
Then saith Pilate unto him,
Speakest thou not unto me? knowest
thou not that I have power to crucify
thee, and have power to release thee?
Jesus answered, Thou couldest have
no power at all against me, except it
were given thee from above: therefore
he that delivered me unto thee
hath the greater sin. And from
thenceforth Pilate sought to release
him: but the Jews cried out, saying,
If thou let this man go, thou art not
Cæsar's friend: whosoever maketh
himself a king speaketh against Cæsar.
When Pilate therefore heard
that saying, he brought Jesus forth,
and sat down in the judgment seat
in a place that is called the Pavement,
but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. And
it was the preparation of the passover,
and about the sixth hour: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
he saith unto the Jews, Behold your
King! But they cried out, Away
with him, away with him, crucify
him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall
I crucify your King? The chief
priests answered, We have no king
but Cæsar. Then delivered he him
therefore unto them to be crucified.
And they took Jesus, and led him
away.</p>

<p>And as they led him away, they
laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian,
coming out of the country, and
on him they laid the cross, that he
might bear it after Jesus. And there
followed him a great company of
people, and of women, which also bewailed
and lamented him. But Jesus
turning unto them said, Daughters
of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but
weep for yourselves, and for your
children. And there were also two
other, malefactors, led with him to
be put to death. And when they
were come to the place, which is
called Calvary, there they crucified
him, and the malefactors, one on the
right hand, and the other on the left.
Then said Jesus, Father, forgive
them; for they know not what they
do. And they parted his raiment,
and cast lots. And the people stood
beholding. And the rulers also with
them derided him, saying, He saved
others; let him save himself, if he be
Christ, the chosen of God. And the
soldiers also mocked him, coming to
him, and offering him vinegar, and
saying, If thou be the king of the
Jews, save thyself. And Pilate wrote
a title, and put it on the cross. And
the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH
THE KING OF THE
JEWS. This title then read many
of the Jews: for the place where Jesus
was crucified was nigh to the city:
and it was written in Hebrew, and
Greek, and Latin. Then said the
chief priests of the Jews to Pilate,
Write not, The King of the Jews;
but that he said, I am King of the
Jews. Pilate answered, What I have
written I have written.</p>

<p>And one of the malefactors which
were hanged railed on him, saying,
If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
But the other answering rebuked
him, saying, Dost not thou fear God,
seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
And we indeed justly; for
we receive the due reward of our
deeds: but this man hath done nothing
amiss. And he said unto Jesus,
Lord, remember me when thou comest
into thy kingdom. And Jesus
said unto him, Verily I say unto thee,
To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
And it was about the sixth
hour, and there was a darkness over
all the earth until the ninth hour.</p>

<p>Now there stood by the cross of
Jesus his mother, and his mother's
sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas,
and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus
therefore saw his mother, and the
disciple standing by, whom he loved,
he saith unto his mother, Woman,
behold thy son! Then saith he to the
disciple, Behold thy mother! And
from that hour that disciple took her
unto his own home.</p>

<p>Now from the sixth hour there
was darkness over all the land unto
the ninth hour. And about the ninth
hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?
that is to say, My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me? Some of them
that stood there, when they heard
that, said, This man calleth for Elias.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
And straightway one of them ran,
and took a spunge, and filled it with
vinegar, and put it on a reed, and
gave him to drink. When Jesus
therefore had received the vinegar,
he said, It is finished: and he bowed
his head, and gave up the ghost.</p>

</div>

<p>The Jews therefore, because it was
the preparation, that the bodies
should not remain upon the cross on
the sabbath day, (for that sabbath
day was an high day,) besought Pilate
that their legs might be broken,
and that they might be taken away.
Then came the soldiers, and brake
the legs of the first, and of the other
which was crucified with him. But
when they came to Jesus, and saw
that he was dead already, they brake
not his legs: but one of the soldiers
with a spear pierced his side, and
forthwith came there out blood and
water. And he that saw it bare record,
and his record is true: and he
knoweth that he saith true, that ye
might believe. For these things were
done, that the scripture should be fulfilled,
A bone of him shall not be
broken. And again another scripture
saith, They shall look on him whom
they pierced. And, behold, the veil
of the temple was rent in twain
from the top to the bottom; and the
earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
and the graves were opened; and
many bodies of the saints which
slept arose, and came out of the
graves after his resurrection, and
went into the holy city, and appeared
unto many. Now when the centurion,
and they that were with him, watching
Jesus, saw the earthquake, and
those things that were done, they
feared greatly, saying, Truly this was
the Son of God. When the even was
come, there came a rich man of Arimathæa,
named Joseph, who also
himself was Jesus' disciple: he went
to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
Then Pilate commanded the
body to be delivered. And when Joseph
had taken the body, he wrapped
it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it
in his own new tomb, which he had
hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a
great stone to the door of the sepulchre,
and departed. And there was
Mary Magdalene, and the other
Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</p>

<p>Now the next day, that followed
the day of the preparation, the chief
priests and Pharisees came together
unto Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember
that that deceiver said, while he
was yet alive, After three days I will
rise again. Command therefore that
the sepulchre be made sure until the
third day, lest his disciples come by
night, and steal him away, and say
unto the people, He is risen from the
dead: so the last error shall be worse
than the first. Pilate said unto
them, Ye have a watch: go your way,
make it as sure as ye can. So they
went, and made the sepulchre sure,
sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</p>

<small>THE RESURRECTION</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Matthew 28</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>IN the end of the sabbath, as it
began to dawn toward the first
day of the week, came Mary
Magdalene and the other Mary to see
the sepulchre. And, behold, there
was a great earthquake: for the angel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
of the Lord descended from heaven,
and came and rolled back the stone
from the door, and sat upon it. His
countenance was like lightning, and
his raiment white as snow: and for
fear of him the keepers did shake,
and became as dead men. And the
angel answered and said unto the
women, Fear not ye: for I know that
ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
He is not here: for he is risen, as he
said. Come, see the place where the
Lord lay. And go quickly, and tell
his disciples that he is risen from the
dead; and, behold, he goeth before
you into Galilee; there shall ye see
him: lo, I have told you. And they
departed quickly from the sepulchre
with fear and great joy; and did run
to bring his disciples word. Peter
therefore went forth, and that other
disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
So they ran both together: and the
other disciple did outrun Peter, and
came first to the sepulchre. And he
stooping down, and looking in, saw
the linen clothes lying; yet went he
not in. Then cometh Simon Peter
following him, and went into the sepulchre,
and seeth the linen clothes lie,
and the napkin, that was about his
head, not lying with the linen clothes,
but wrapped together in a place by
itself. Then went in also that other
disciple, which came first to the
sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
For as yet they knew not
the scripture, that he must rise
again from the dead. Then the disciples
went away again unto their
own home.</div>

<div class="sidenote">St. John 20</div>

<p>But Mary stood without at the sepulchre
weeping: and as she wept, she
stooped down, and looked into the
sepulchre, and seeth two angels in
white sitting, the one at the head, and
the other at the feet, where the body
of Jesus had lain. And they say unto
her, Woman, why weepest thou? She
saith unto them, Because they have
taken away my Lord, and I know
not where they have laid him. And
when she had thus said, she turned
herself back, and saw Jesus standing,
and knew not that it was Jesus.
Jesus saith unto her, Woman,
why weepest thou? whom seekest
thou? She, supposing him to be
the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if
thou have borne him hence, tell
me where thou hast laid him, and
I will take him away. Jesus saith
unto her, Mary. She turned herself,
and saith unto him, Rabboni;
which is to say, Master. Jesus saith
unto her, Touch me not; for I am
not yet ascended to my Father: but
go to my brethren, and say unto
them, I ascend unto my Father,
and your Father; and to my God,
and your God. Mary Magdalene
came and told the disciples that
she had seen the Lord, and that
he had spoken these things unto
her. Now when they were going,
behold, some of the watch came
into the city, and shewed unto the
chief priests all the things that
were done. And when they were
assembled with the elders, and had
taken counsel, they gave large money
unto the soldiers, saying, Say ye, His
disciples came by night, and stole him
away while we slept. And if this
come to the governor's ears, we will
persuade him, and secure you. So
they took the money, and did as they
were taught: and this saying is
commonly reported among the Jews
until this day.</p>

<small>APPEARANCES OF CHRIST AFTER
THE RESURRECTION</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">St. Luke 24</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND, behold, two of them went
that same day to a village
called Emmaus, which was
from Jerusalem about threescore
furlongs. And they talked together
of all these things which had happened.
And it came to pass, that,
while they communed together and
reasoned, Jesus himself drew near,
and went with them. But their eyes
were holden that they should not
know him. And he said unto them,
What manner of communications are
these that ye have one to another, as
ye walk, and are sad? And the one
of them, whose name was Cleopas,
answering said unto him, Art thou
only a stranger in Jerusalem, and
hast not known the things which are
come to pass there in these days?
And he said unto them, What things?
And they said unto him, Concerning
Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet
mighty in deed and word before
God and all the people: and how the
chief priests and our rulers delivered
him to be condemned to death, and
have crucified him. But we trusted
that it had been he which should have
redeemed Israel: and beside all this,
to day is the third day since these
things were done. Yea, and certain
women also of our company made us
astonished, which were early at the
sepulchre; and when they found not
his body, they came, saying, that they
had also seen a vision of angels,
which said that he was alive. And
certain of them which were with us
went to the sepulchre, and found it
even so as the women had said: but
him they saw not.</div>

<div class="sidenote">St. John 20</div>

<p>Then he said unto them, O fools,
and slow of heart to believe all that
the prophets have spoken: ought not
Christ to have suffered these things,
and to enter into his glory? And beginning
at Moses and all the prophets,
he expounded unto them in all
the scriptures the things concerning
himself. And they drew nigh unto
the village, whither they went: and
he made as though he would have
gone further. But they constrained
him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
toward evening, and the day is far
spent. And he went in to tarry with
them. And it came to pass, as he sat
at meat with them, he took bread, and
blessed it, and brake, and gave to
them. And their eyes were opened,
and they knew him; and he vanished
out of their sight. And they said one
to another, Did not our heart burn
within us, while he talked with us by
the way, and while he opened to us
the scriptures? And they rose up
the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem,
and found the eleven gathered
together, and them that were with
them, saying, The Lord is risen indeed,
and hath appeared to Simon.
And they told what things were done
in the way, and how he was known
of them in breaking of bread. And
as they thus spake, Jesus himself
stood in the midst of them, and
saith unto them, Peace be unto you.
But they were terrified and affrighted,
and supposed that they had
seen a spirit. And he said unto them,
Why are ye troubled? and why do
thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold
my hands and my feet, that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
I myself: handle me, and see; for a
spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye
see me have. And when he had thus
spoken, he shewed them his hands
and his feet. And while they yet believed
not for joy, and wondered, he
said unto them, Have ye here any
meat? And they gave him a piece
of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
And he took it, and did eat
before them. Then said Jesus to
them again, Peace be unto you: as my
Father hath sent me, even so send I
you. And when he had said this, he
breathed on them, and saith unto
them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
whose soever sins ye remit, they are
remitted unto them; and whose soever
sins ye retain, they are retained.
But Thomas, one of the twelve, called
Didymus, was not with them when
Jesus came. The other disciples
therefore said unto him, We have
seen the Lord. But he said unto
them, Except I shall see in his hands
the print of the nails, and put my
finger into the print of the nails, and
thrust my hand into his side, I will
not believe.</p>
<p>And after eight days again his disciples
were within, and Thomas with
them: then came Jesus, the doors
being shut, and stood in the midst,
and said, Peace be unto you. Then
saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy
finger, and behold my hands; and
reach hither thy hand, and thrust it
into my side: and be not faithless, but
believing. And Thomas answered
and said unto him, My Lord and my
God. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas,
because thou hast seen me, thou hast
believed: blessed are they that have
not seen, and yet have believed.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, These are
the words which I spake unto you,
while I was yet with you, that all
things must be fulfilled, which were
written in the law of Moses, and in
the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning
me. Then opened he their
understanding, that they might understand
the scriptures, and said
unto them, Thus it is written, and
thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and
to rise from the dead the third day:
and that repentance and remission of
sins should be preached in his name
among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
And ye are witnesses of these
things. And, behold, I send the
promise of my Father upon you: but
tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem,
until ye be endued with power from
on high.</p>

<p>After these things Jesus shewed
himself again to the disciples at the
sea of Tiberias; and on this wise
shewed he himself. There were together
Simon Peter, and Thomas
called Didymus, and Nathanael of
Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee,
and two other of his disciples.
Simon Peter saith unto them, I go
a fishing. They say unto him, We
also go with thee. They went forth,
and entered into a ship immediately;
and that night they caught nothing.
But when the morning was now come,
Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples
knew not that it was Jesus.
Then Jesus saith unto them, Children,
have ye any meat? They answered
him, No. And he said unto
them, Cast the net on the right side
of the ship, and ye shall find. They
cast therefore, and now they were
not able to draw it for the multitude
of fishes. Therefore that disciple
whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter,
It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter
heard that it was the Lord, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for
he was naked,) and did cast himself
into the sea. And the other disciples
came in a little ship; (for they were
not far from land, but as it were two
hundred cubits,) dragging the net
with fishes. As soon then as they
were come to land, they saw a fire of
coals there, and fish laid thereon, and
bread. Jesus saith unto them, Bring
of the fish which ye have now caught.
Simon Peter went up, and drew the
net to land full of great fishes, an
hundred and fifty and three: and for
all there were so many, yet was not
the net broken. Jesus saith unto
them, Come and dine. And none of
the disciples durst ask him, Who art
thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread,
and giveth them, and fish likewise.</p>

<p>So when they had dined, Jesus
saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of
Jonas, lovest thou me more than
these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord;
thou knowest that I love thee. He
saith unto him, Feed my lambs. He
saith to him again the second time,
Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?
He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou
knowest that I love thee. He saith
unto him, Feed my sheep. He saith
unto him the third time, Simon, son
of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was
grieved because he said unto him
the third time, Lovest thou me? And
he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest
all things; thou knowest that I love
thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my
sheep. Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, When thou wast young, thou
girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither
thou wouldest: but when thou shalt
be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy
hands, and another shall gird thee,
and carry thee whither thou wouldest
not. This spake he, signifying by
what death he should glorify God.
And when he had spoken this, he
saith unto him, Follow me. Then
Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple
whom Jesus loved following;
which also leaned on his breast at
supper, and said, Lord, which is he
that betrayeth thee? Peter seeing
him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what
shall this man do? Jesus saith unto
him, If I will that he tarry till I come,
what is that to thee? follow thou me.</p>

<p>And there are also many other
things which Jesus did, the which, if
they should be written every one, I
suppose that even the world itself
could not contain the books that
should be written. Amen.</p>

to Bethany, and he lifted up
his hands, and blessed them.
And it came to pass, while he blessed
them, he was parted from them, and
carried up into heaven. And while
they looked stedfastly toward heaven
as he went up, behold, two men stood
by them in white apparel; which also
said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand

<small>THE HOLY SPIRIT GIVEN</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="150" height="173" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">AND the apostles
appointed two,
Joseph called
Barsabas, who
was surnamed
Justus, and Matthias.
And they
prayed, and said,
Thou, Lord, which
knowest the hearts of all men, shew
whether of these two thou hast
chosen, that he may take part of this
ministry and apostleship, from which
Judas by transgression fell, that he
might go to his own place. And they
gave forth their lots; and the lot fell
upon Matthias; and he was numbered
with the eleven apostles.</div>

<p>And when the day of Pentecost
was fully come, they were all with one
accord in one place. And suddenly
there came a sound from heaven as
of a rushing mighty wind, and it
filled all the house where they were
sitting. And there appeared unto
them cloven tongues like as of fire,
and it sat upon each of them. And
they were all filled with the Holy
Ghost, and began to speak with other
tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
And there were dwelling
at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out
of every nation under heaven. Now
when this was noised abroad, the
multitude came together, and were
confounded, because that every man
heard them speak in his own language.
And they were all amazed
and marvelled, saying one to another,
Behold, are not all these which speak
Galilæans? And how hear we every
man in our own tongue, wherein we
were born? Others mocking said,
These men are full of new wine. But
Peter, standing up with the eleven,
lifted up his voice, and said unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
them, Ye men of Judæa, and all ye
that dwell at Jerusalem, be this
known unto you, and hearken to my
words: for these are not drunken, as
ye suppose, seeing it is but the third
hour of the day. But this is that
which was spoken by the prophet
Joel; And it shall come to pass in the
last days, saith God, I will pour out
of my Spirit upon all flesh. And I
will shew wonders in heaven above,
and signs in the earth beneath; and
it shall come to pass, that whosoever
shall call on the name of the Lord
shall be saved.</p>

<p>Ye men of Israel, hear these
words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved
of God among you by miracles
and wonders and signs, which
God did by him in the midst of you,
as ye yourselves also know: him,
being delivered by the determinate
counsel and foreknowledge of God,
ye have taken, and by wicked hands
have crucified and slain: whom God
hath raised up, having loosed the
pains of death: because it was not
possible that he should be holden of
it. Therefore being by the right
hand of God exalted, and having received
of the Father the promise of
the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth
this, which ye now see and hear.
Therefore let all the house of Israel
know assuredly, that God hath made
that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified,
both Lord and Christ.</p>

<p>Now when they heard this, they
were pricked in their heart, and said
unto Peter and to the rest of the
apostles, Men and brethren, what
shall we do? Then Peter said unto
them, Repent, and be baptized every
one of you in the name of Jesus
Christ for the remission of sins, and
ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
Ghost. For the promise is unto you,
and to your children, and to all that
are afar off, even as many as the Lord
our God shall call.</p>

<p>Then they that gladly received his
word were baptized: and the same
day there were added unto them
about three thousand souls. And
they continued stedfastly in the apostles'
doctrine and fellowship, and in
breaking of bread, and in prayers.
And fear came upon every soul: and
many wonders and signs were done
by the apostles. And they, continuing
daily with one accord in the temple,
and breaking bread from house
to house, did eat their meat with
gladness and singleness of heart,
praising God, and having favour
with all the people. And the Lord
added to the church daily such as
should be saved.</p>

<small>PETER AND JOHN CURE THE
LAME MAN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 3</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW Peter and John went up
together into the temple at
the hour of prayer, being
the ninth hour. And a certain man
lame from his birth was carried,
whom they laid daily at the gate of
the temple which is called Beautiful,
to ask alms of them that entered into
the temple; who seeing Peter and
John about to go into the temple
asked an alms. And Peter, fastening
his eyes upon him with John, said,
Look on us. And he gave heed unto
them, expecting to receive something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
of them. Then Peter said, Silver and
gold have I none; but such as I have
give I thee: In the name of Jesus
Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.
And he took him by the right hand,
and lifted him up: and immediately
his feet and ancle bones received
strength. And he leaping up stood,
and walked, and entered with them
into the temple, walking, and leaping,
and praising God. And all the
people saw him walking and praising
God: and they knew that it was he
which sat for alms at the Beautiful
gate of the temple: and they were
filled with wonder and amazement at
that which had happened unto him.
And as the lame man which was
healed held Peter and John, all the
people ran together unto them in
the porch that is called Solomon's,
greatly wondering.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Acts 4</div>

<p>And as they spake unto the people,
the priests, and the captain of the
temple, and the Sadducees, came
upon them, being grieved that they
taught the people, and preached
through Jesus the resurrection from
the dead. And they laid hands on
them, and put them in hold unto the
next day: for it was now eventide.
Howbeit many of them which heard
the word believed; and the number
of the men was about five thousand.</p>

<p>And it came to pass on the morrow,
that their rulers, and elders, and
scribes, and Annas the high priest,
and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander,
and as many as were of the
kindred of the high priest, were
gathered together at Jerusalem.
And when they had set them in the
midst, they asked, By what power, or
by what name, have ye done this?
Then Peter, filled with the Holy
Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of
the people, and elders of Israel, if we
this day be examined of the good
deed done to the impotent man, by
what means he is made whole; be it
known unto you all, and to all the
people of Israel, that by the name of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye
crucified, whom God raised from the
dead, even by him doth this man
stand here before you whole. This
is the stone which was set at nought
of you builders, which is become the
head of the corner. Neither is there
salvation in any other: for there is
none other name under heaven given
among men, whereby we must be
saved.</p>

<p>Now when they saw the boldness
of Peter and John, and perceived
that they were unlearned and ignorant
men, they marvelled; and they
took knowledge of them, that they
had been with Jesus. And beholding
the man which was healed standing
with them, they could say nothing
against it. But when they had commanded
them to go aside out of the
council, they conferred among themselves.
And they called them, and
commanded them not to speak at all
nor teach in the name of Jesus. But
Peter and John answered and said
unto them, Whether it be right in
the sight of God to hearken unto you
more than unto God, judge ye. For
we cannot but speak the things which
we have seen and heard. So when
they had further threatened them,
they let them go, finding nothing
how they might punish them, because
of the people: for all men glorified
God for that which was done. For
the man was above forty years old,
on whom this miracle of healing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
shewed. And being let go, they went
to their own company, and reported
all that the chief priests and elders
had said unto them.</p>

<p>And the multitude of them that believed
were of one heart and of one
soul: neither said any of them that
ought of the things which he possessed
was his own; but they had all
things common. Neither was there
any among them that lacked: for as
many as were possessors of lands or

prices of the things that were sold,

<small>ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 5</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>BUT a certain man named Ananias,
with Sapphira his wife,
sold a possession, and kept
back part of the price, his wife also
being privy to it, and brought a certain
part, and laid it at the apostles'
feet. But Peter said, Ananias, why
hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to
the Holy Ghost, and to keep back
part of the price of the land? While
it remained, was it not thine own?
and after it was sold, was it not in
thine own power? why hast thou conceived
this thing in thine heart? thou
hast not lied unto men, but unto God.
And Ananias hearing these words
fell down, and gave up the ghost: and
great fear came on all them that
heard these things. And the young
men arose, wound him up, and carried
him out, and buried him.</div>

<p>And it was about the space of three
hours after, when his wife, not knowing
what was done, came in. And
Peter answered unto her, Tell me
whether ye sold the land for so much?
And she said, Yea, for so much.
Then Peter said unto her, How is it
that ye have agreed together to tempt
the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the
feet of them which have buried thy
husband are at the door, and shall
carry thee out. Then fell she down
straightway at his feet, and yielded
up the ghost: and the young men
came in, and found her dead, and,
carrying her forth, buried her by her
husband. And great fear came upon
all the church, and upon as many as
heard these things.</p>

<p>And by the hands of the apostles
were many signs and wonders
wrought among the people. And
believers were the more added to the
Lord, multitudes both of men and
women. Insomuch that they brought
forth the sick into the streets, and
laid them on beds and couches, that
at the least the shadow of Peter passing
by might overshadow some of
them. There came also a multitude
out of the cities round about unto
Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and
them which were vexed with unclean
spirits: and they were healed every
one.</p>

<p>Then the high priest rose up, and
all they that were with him, and laid
their hands on the apostles, and put
them in the common prison. But the
angel of the Lord by night opened the
prison doors, and brought them forth,
and said, Go, stand and speak in the
temple to the people all the words of
this life. And when they heard that,
they entered into the temple early in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
the morning, and taught. But the
high priest came, and they that were
with him, and called the council together,
and all the senate of the children
of Israel, and sent to the prison
to have them brought. But when the
officers came, and found them not in
the prison, they returned, and told,
saying, The prison truly found we
shut with all safety, and the keepers
standing without before the doors:
but when we had opened, we found
no man within. Then came one and
told them, saying, Behold, the men
whom ye put in prison are standing
in the temple, and teaching the people.
Then went the captain with the
officers, and brought them without
violence: for they feared the people,
lest they should have been stoned.
And when they had brought them,
they set them before the council: and
the high priest asked them, saying,
Did not we straitly command you that
ye should not teach in this name? and,
behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with
your doctrine, and intend to bring
this man's blood upon us.</p>

<p>Then Peter and the other apostles
answered and said, We ought to obey
God rather than men. The God of
our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye
slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath
God exalted with his right hand to
be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give
repentance to Israel, and forgiveness
of sins. And we are his witnesses of
these things; and so is also the Holy
Ghost, whom God hath given to them
that obey him.</p>

<p>When they heard that, they were
cut to the heart, and took counsel to
slay them. Then stood there up one
in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel,
a doctor of the law, had in
reputation among all the people, and
commanded to put the apostles forth
a little space; and said unto them, Ye
men of Israel, refrain from these
men, and let them alone: for if this
counsel or this work be of men, it will
come to nought: but if it be of God,
ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply
ye be found even to fight against God.
And to him they agreed: and when
they had called the apostles, and
beaten them, they commanded that
they should not speak in the name of
Jesus, and let them go. And they
departed from the presence of the
council, rejoicing that they were
counted worthy to suffer shame for
his name. And daily in the temple,
and in every house, they ceased not
to teach and preach Jesus Christ.</p>

<small>STEPHEN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 6</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Stephen, full of faith and
power, did great wonders and
miracles among the people.
Then there arose certain of the synagogue,
disputing with Stephen. And
they were not able to resist the wisdom
and the spirit by which he spake.
Then they suborned men, which said,
We have heard him speak blasphemous
words against Moses, and
against God. And they stirred up
the people, and the elders, and the
scribes, and came upon him, and
caught him, and brought him to the
council, and set up false witnesses,
which said, This man ceaseth not to
speak blasphemous words against
this holy place, and the law: for we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
have heard him say, that this Jesus
of Nazareth shall destroy this place,
and shall change the customs which
Moses delivered us. And all that sat
in the council, looking stedfastly on
him, saw his face as it had been the
face of an angel.</div>

<p>Then said the high priest, Are
these things so? And Stephen answered
and said, Which of the prophets
have not your fathers persecuted?
and they have slain them
which shewed before of the coming
of the Just One; of whom ye have
been now the betrayers and murderers:
who have received the law by the
disposition of angels, and have not
kept it.</p>

<p>When they heard these things,
they were cut to the heart, and they
gnashed on him with their teeth. But
he, being full of the Holy Ghost,
looked up stedfastly into heaven, and
saw the glory of God, and Jesus
standing on the right hand of God,
and said, Behold, I see the heavens
opened, and the Son of man
standing on the right hand of God.
Then they cried out with a loud voice,
and stopped their ears, and ran upon
him with one accord, and cast him
out of the city, and stoned him: and
the witnesses laid down their clothes
at a young man's feet, whose name
was Saul. And they stoned Stephen,
calling upon God, and saying, Lord
Jesus, receive my spirit. And he
kneeled down, and cried with a loud
voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their
charge. And when he had said this,
he fell asleep. And Saul was consenting
unto his death. And at that
time there was a great persecution
against the church which was at Jerusalem;
and they were all scattered
abroad throughout the regions of Judæa
and Samaria, except the apostles.
And devout men carried Stephen to
his burial, and made great lamentation
over him. As for Saul, he made
havock of the church, entering into
every house, and haling men and
women committed them to prison.
Therefore they that were scattered
abroad went every where preaching
the word.</p>

<small>SIMON THE SORCERER&mdash;THE
ETHIOPIAN EUNUCH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 8</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THEN Philip went down to the
city of Samaria, and preached
Christ unto them. And the
people with one accord gave heed
unto those things which Philip spake,
hearing and seeing the miracles
which he did. And there was great
joy in that city. But there was a certain
man, called Simon, which beforetime
in the same city used sorcery,
and bewitched the people of Samaria,
giving out that himself was some
great one: to whom they all gave
heed, from the least to the greatest,
saying, This man is the great power
of God. But when they believed
Philip preaching the things concerning
the kingdom of God, and the
name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized,
both men and women. Then
Simon himself believed also: and
when he was baptized, he continued
with Philip, and wondered, beholding
the miracles and signs which
were done.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>Now when the apostles which were
at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
had received the word of God, they
sent unto them Peter and John: who,
when they were come down, prayed
for them, that they might receive the
Holy Ghost: (for as yet he was fallen
upon none of them: only they were
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
Then laid they their hands on
them, and they received the Holy
Ghost. And when Simon saw that
through laying on of the apostles'
hands the Holy Ghost was given, he
offered them money, saying, Give
me also this power, that on whomsoever
I lay hands, he may receive
the Holy Ghost. But Peter said unto
him, Thy money perish with thee,
because thou hast thought that the
gift of God may be purchased with
money. Thou hast neither part nor
lot in this matter: for thy heart is
not right in the sight of God. Repent
therefore of this thy wickedness, and
pray God, if perhaps the thought of
thine heart may be forgiven thee.
For I perceive that thou art in the
gall of bitterness, and in the bond of
iniquity. Then answered Simon, and
said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that
none of these things which ye have
spoken come upon me. And they,
when they had testified and preached
the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem,
and preached the gospel in
many villages of the Samaritans.</p>

<p>And the angel of the Lord spake
unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go
toward the south unto the way that
goeth down from Jerusalem unto
Gaza, which is desert. And he arose
and went: and, behold, a man of
Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority
under Candace queen of the
Ethiopians, who had the charge of all
her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem
for to worship, was returning,
and sitting in his chariot read Esaias
the prophet. Then the Spirit said
unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself
to this chariot. And Philip ran
thither to him, and heard him read
the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest
thou what thou readest?
And he said, How can I, except some
man should guide me? And he desired
Philip that he would come up
and sit with him. The place of the
scripture which he read was this, He
was led as a sheep to the slaughter;
and like a lamb dumb before his
shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
in his humiliation his judgment was
taken away: and who shall declare
his generation? for his life is taken
from the earth. And the eunuch answered
Philip, and said, I pray thee,
of whom speaketh the prophet this?
of himself, or of some other man?
Then Philip opened his mouth, and
began at the same scripture, and
preached unto him Jesus. And as
they went on their way, they came
unto a certain water: and the eunuch
said, See, here is water; what doth
hinder me to be baptized? And Philip
said, If thou believest with all
thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered
and said, I believe that Jesus
Christ is the Son of God. And he
commanded the chariot to stand still:
and they went down both into the
water, both Philip and the eunuch;
and he baptized him. And when they
were come up out of the water, the
Spirit of the Lord caught away
Philip, that the eunuch saw him
no more: and he went on his way
rejoicing.</p>

<small>THE CONVERSION OF SAUL</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND Saul, yet breathing out
threatenings and slaughter
against the disciples of the
Lord, went unto the high priest, and
desired of him letters to Damascus
to the synagogues, that if he found
any of this way, whether they were
men or women, he might bring them
bound unto Jerusalem. And as he
journeyed, he came near Damascus:
and suddenly there shined round
about him a light from heaven: and
he fell to the earth, and heard a voice
saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me? And he said, Who
art thou, Lord? And the Lord said,
I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
And he trembling and astonished
said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to
do? And the Lord said unto him,
Arise, and go into the city, and it
shall be told thee what thou must do.
And the men which journeyed with
him stood speechless, hearing a
voice, but seeing no man. And Saul
arose from the earth; and when his
eyes were opened, he saw no man:
but they led him by the hand, and
brought him into Damascus. And he
was three days without sight, and
neither did eat nor drink.</div>

<p>And there was a certain disciple
at Damascus, named Ananias; and to
him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias.
And he said, Behold, I am
here, Lord. And the Lord said unto
him, Arise, and go into the street
which is called Straight, and enquire
in the house of Judas for one called
Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,
and hath seen in a vision a man
named Ananias coming in, and putting
his hand on him, that he might
receive his sight. Then Ananias answered,
Lord, I have heard by many
of this man, how much evil he hath
done to thy saints at Jerusalem: and
here he hath authority from the chief
priests to bind all that call on thy
name. But the Lord said unto him,
Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel
unto me, to bear my name before the
Gentiles, and kings, and the children
of Israel: for I will shew him how
great things he must suffer for my
name's sake. And Ananias went his
way, and entered into the house; and
putting his hands on him said, Brother
Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that
appeared unto thee in the way as thou
camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest
receive thy sight, and be filled
with the Holy Ghost. And immediately
there fell from his eyes as it
had been scales: and he received
sight forthwith, and arose, and was
baptized. And when he had received
meat, he was strengthened. Then
was Saul certain days with the disciples
which were at Damascus. And
straightway he preached Christ in
the synagogues, that he is the Son of
God.</p>

<p>And after that many days were fulfilled,
the Jews took counsel to kill
him: but their laying await was
known of Saul. And they watched
the gates day and night to kill
him. Then the disciples took him by
night, and let him down by the wall
in a basket. And when Saul was
come to Jerusalem, he assayed to
join himself to the disciples: but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
were all afraid of him, and believed
not that he was a disciple. But Barnabas
took him, and brought him to
the apostles, and declared unto them
how he had seen the Lord in the way,
and that he had spoken to him, and
how he had preached boldly at Damascus
in the name of Jesus.</p>

<small>DORCAS</small></h2>



<div class="sidenote">The Acts 9</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW there was at Joppa a certain
disciple named Tabitha,
which by interpretation is
called Dorcas: this woman was full
of good works and almsdeeds which
she did. And it came to pass in those
days, that she was sick, and died:
whom when they had washed, they
laid her in an upper chamber. And
forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to
Joppa, and the disciples had heard
that Peter was there, they sent unto
him two men, desiring him that he
would not delay to come to them.
Then Peter arose and went with
them. When he was come, they
brought him into the upper chamber:
and all the widows stood by him
weeping, and shewing the coats and
garments which Dorcas made, while
she was with them. But Peter put
them all forth, and kneeled down, and
prayed; and turning him to the body
said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened
her eyes: and when she saw Peter,
she sat up. And he gave her his
hand, and lifted her up, and when he
had called the saints and widows, presented
her alive. And it was known
throughout all Joppa; and many believed
in the Lord.</div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_74_2" id="CHAPTER_74_2">CHAPTER 74</a><br />

<small>CORNELIUS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 10</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THERE was a certain man in
Cæsarea called Cornelius, a
centurion of the band called
the Italian band, a devout man, and
one that feared God with all his
house, which gave much alms to the
people, and prayed to God alway.
He saw in a vision evidently about
the ninth hour of the day an angel of
God coming in to him, and saying
unto him, Cornelius. And when he
looked on him, he was afraid, and
said, What is it, Lord? And he said
unto him, Thy prayers and thine
alms are come up for a memorial before
God. And now send men to
Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose
surname is Peter: he lodgeth with
one Simon a tanner, whose house is
by the sea side: he shall tell thee
what thou oughtest to do. And when
the angel which spake unto Cornelius
was departed, he called two of his
household servants, and a devout
soldier of them that waited on him
continually; and when he had declared
all these things unto them, he
sent them to Joppa.</div>

<p>On the morrow, as they went on
their journey, and drew nigh unto
the city, Peter went up upon the
housetop to pray about the sixth
hour: and he became very hungry,
and would have eaten: but while they
made ready, he fell into a trance, and
saw heaven opened, and a certain
vessel descending unto him, as it had
been a great sheet knit at the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
corners, and let down to the earth:
wherein were all manner of four-footed
beasts of the earth, and wild
beasts, and creeping things, and
fowls of the air. And there came a
voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and
eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord;
for I have never eaten any thing that
is common or unclean. And the voice
spake unto him again the second
time, What God hath cleansed, that
call not thou common. This was done
thrice: and the vessel was received
up again into heaven. Now while
Peter doubted in himself what this
vision which he had seen should
mean, behold, the men which were
sent from Cornelius stood before the
gate, and called, and asked whether
Simon, which was surnamed Peter,
were lodged there.</p>

<p>While Peter thought on the vision,
the Spirit said unto him, Behold,
three men seek thee. Arise therefore,
and get thee down, and go with them,
doubting nothing: for I have sent
them. Then Peter went down to the
men which were sent unto him from
Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am
he whom ye seek: what is the cause
wherefore ye are come? And they
said, Cornelius the centurion, a just
man, and one that feareth God, and of
good report among all the nation of
the Jews, was warned from God by
an holy angel to send for thee into
his house, and to hear words of thee.
Then called he them in, and lodged
them. And on the morrow Peter
went away with them, and certain
brethren from Joppa accompanied
him.</p>

<p>And the morrow after they entered
into Cæsarea. And Cornelius waited
for them, and had called together
his kinsmen and near friends. And
as Peter was coming in, Cornelius
met him, and fell down at his feet,
and worshipped him. But Peter took
him up, saying, Stand up; I myself
also am a man. And as he talked
with him, he went in, and found many
that were come together. And he
said unto them, Ye know how that it
is an unlawful thing for a man that
is a Jew to keep company, or come
unto one of another nation; but God
hath shewed me that I should not call
any man common or unclean. Therefore
came I unto you without gainsaying,
as soon as I was sent for: I
ask therefore for what intent ye have
sent for me? And Cornelius said,
Four days ago I was fasting until
this hour; and at the ninth hour I
prayed in my house, and, behold, a
man stood before me in bright clothing,
and said, Cornelius, thy prayer
is heard, and thine alms are had in
remembrance in the sight of God.
Send therefore to Joppa, and call
hither Simon, whose surname is Peter;
he is lodged in the house of one
Simon a tanner by the sea side: who,
when he cometh, shall speak unto
thee. Immediately therefore I sent
to thee; and thou hast well done that
thou art come. Now therefore are
we all here present before God, to
hear all things that are commanded
thee of God.</p>

<p>Then Peter opened his mouth, and
said, Of a truth I perceive that God
is no respecter of persons: but in
every nation he that feareth him, and
worketh righteousness, is accepted
with him. The word which God sent
unto the children of Israel, preaching
peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of
all:) that word, I say, ye know, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
was published throughout all Judæa,
and began from Galilee, after the
baptism which John preached; how
God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
with the Holy Ghost and with power:
who went about doing good, and healing
all that were oppressed of the
devil; for God was with him. And
we are witnesses of all things which
he did both in the land of the Jews,
and in Jerusalem; whom they slew
and hanged on a tree: him God raised
up the third day, and shewed him
openly; not to all the people, but unto
witnesses chosen before of God, even
to us, who did eat and drink with him
after he rose from the dead. And
he commanded us to preach unto the
people, and to testify that it is he
which was ordained of God to be the
Judge of quick and dead. To him
give all the prophets witness, that
through his name whosoever believeth
in him shall receive remission of
sins.</p>

<p>While Peter yet spake these words,
the Holy Ghost fell on all them which
heard the word. And they of the circumcision
which believed were astonished,
as many as came with Peter,
because that on the Gentiles also was
poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.
For they heard them speak with
tongues, and magnify God. Then answered
Peter, Can any man forbid
water, that these should not be baptized,
which have received the Holy
Ghost as well as we? And he commanded
them to be baptized in the
name of the Lord. Then prayed they
him to tarry certain days.</p>

<p>Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus,
for to seek Saul: and when he
had found him, he brought him unto
Antioch. And it came to pass, that
a whole year they assembled themselves
with the church, and taught
much people. And the disciples were
called Christians first in Antioch.</p>

<p>And in these days came prophets
from Jerusalem unto Antioch. And
there stood up one of them named
Agabus, and signified by the Spirit
that there should be great dearth
throughout all the world: which came
to pass in the days of Claudius Cæsar.
Then the disciples, every man according
to his ability, determined to
send relief unto the brethren which
dwelt in Judæa: which also they did,
and sent it to the elders by the hands
of Barnabas and Saul.</p>

<small>PETER IN PRISON</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 12</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW about that time Herod
the king stretched forth his
hands to vex certain of the
church. And he killed James the
brother of John with the sword. And
because he saw it pleased the Jews,
he proceeded further to take Peter
also. And when he had apprehended
him, he put him in prison, and delivered
him to four quaternions of soldiers
to keep him; intending after
Easter to bring him forth to the people.
Peter therefore was kept in
prison: but prayer was made without
ceasing of the church unto God for
him. And when Herod would have
brought him forth, the same night
Peter was sleeping between two soldiers,
bound with two chains: and the
keepers before the door kept the
prison. And, behold, the angel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
the Lord came upon him, and a light
shined in the prison: and he smote
Peter on the side, and raised him up,
saying, Arise up quickly. And his
chains fell off from his hands. And
the angel said unto him, Gird thyself,
and bind on thy sandals. And so he
did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy
garment about thee, and follow me.
And he went out, and followed him;
and wist not that it was true
which was done by the angel; but
thought he saw a vision. When
they were past the first and the second
ward, they came unto the iron
gate that leadeth unto the city; which
opened to them of his own accord:
and they went out, and passed on
through one street; and forthwith the
angel departed from him. And when
Peter was come to himself, he said,
Now I know of a surety, that the Lord
hath sent his angel, and hath delivered
me out of the hand of Herod,
and from all the expectation of the
people of the Jews. And when he
had considered the thing, he came to
the house of Mary the mother of
John, whose surname was Mark;
where many were gathered together
praying. And as Peter knocked at
the door of the gate, a damsel came
to hearken, named Rhoda. And
when she knew Peter's voice, she
opened not the gate for gladness, but
ran in, and told how Peter stood before
the gate. And they said unto
her, Thou art mad. But she constantly
affirmed that it was even so.
Then said they, It is his angel. But
Peter continued knocking: and when
they had opened the door, and saw
him, they were astonished. But he,
beckoning unto them with the hand
to hold their peace, declared unto
them how the Lord had brought him
out of the prison. And he said, Go
shew these things unto James, and to
the brethren. And he departed, and
went into another place. Now as
soon as it was day, there was no small
stir among the soldiers, what was become
of Peter. And when Herod
had sought for him, and found him
not, he examined the keepers, and
commanded that they should be put
to death. And he went down from
Judæa to Cæsarea, and there abode.</div>

<p>And upon a set day Herod, arrayed
in royal apparel, sat upon his throne,
and made an oration unto them. And
the people gave a shout, saying, It is
the voice of a god, and not of a man.
And immediately the angel of the
Lord smote him, because he gave not
God the glory: and he was eaten of
worms, and gave up the ghost.</p>

<small>MISSION OF PAUL AND BARNABAS
TO THE GENTILES</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 13</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW there were in the church
that was at Antioch certain
prophets and teachers; as
Barnabas, and Simeon, and Lucius
of Cyrene, and Manaen, and Saul.
As they ministered to the Lord, and
fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate
me Barnabas and Saul for the work
whereunto I have called them. And
when they had fasted and prayed,
and laid their hands on them, they
sent them away. So they, being sent
forth by the Holy Ghost, departed
unto Seleucia; and from thence they
sailed to Cyprus. And when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
were at Salamis, they preached the
word of God in the synagogues of the
Jews: and they had also John to their
minister.</div>

<p>And when they had gone through
the isle unto Paphos, they found a
certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a
Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus:
which was with the deputy of the
country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent
man; who called for Barnabas and
Saul, and desired to hear the word
of God. But Elymas the sorcerer
(for so is his name by interpretation)
withstood them, seeking to turn away
the deputy from the faith. Then
Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled
with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on
him, and said, O full of all subtilty
and all mischief, thou child of the
devil, thou enemy of all righteousness,
wilt thou not cease to pervert
the right ways of the Lord? And
now, behold, the hand of the Lord is
upon thee, and thou shalt be blind,
not seeing the sun for a season. And
immediately there fell on him a mist
and a darkness; and he went about
seeking some to lead him by the hand.
Then the deputy, when he saw what
was done, believed, being astonished
at the doctrine of the Lord.</p>

<p>Now when Paul and his company
loosed from Paphos, they came to
Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing
from them returned to Jerusalem.
But when they departed from
Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia,
and went into the synagogue
on the sabbath day, and sat down.
And after the reading of the law and
the prophets the rulers of the synagogue
sent unto them, saying, Ye men
and brethren, if ye have any word of
exhortation for the people, say on.
Then Paul stood up, and preached
unto them of Jesus and the resurrection.
And when the Jews were gone
out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought
that these words might be
preached to them the next sabbath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Acts 14</div>

<p>And the next sabbath day came almost
the whole city together to hear
the word of God. But when the Jews
saw the multitudes, they were filled
with envy, and spake against those
things which were spoken by Paul,
contradicting and blaspheming. Then
Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and
said, It was necessary that the word
of God should first have been spoken
to you: but seeing ye put it from you,
and judge yourselves unworthy of
everlasting life, lo, we turn to the
Gentiles. For so hath the Lord commanded
us, saying, I have set thee to
be a light of the Gentiles, that thou
shouldest be for salvation unto the
ends of the earth. And when the
Gentiles heard this, they were glad,
and glorified the word of the Lord:
and as many as were ordained to eternal
life believed. And the word of
the Lord was published throughout
all the region. But the Jews stirred
up the devout and honourable women,
and the chief men of the city, and
raised persecution against Paul and
Barnabas, and expelled them out of
their coasts. But they shook off the
dust of their feet against them, and
came unto Iconium. And the disciples
were filled with joy, and with the
Holy Ghost. And they came unto
Lystra. And there sat a certain man,
impotent in his feet, being a cripple
who never had walked: the same
heard Paul speak: who stedfastly
beholding him, and perceiving that
he had faith to be healed, said with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
loud voice, Stand upright on thy
feet. And he leaped and walked.
And when the people saw what Paul
had done, they lifted up their voices,
saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The
gods are come down to us in the likeness
of men. And they called Barnabas,
Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius,
because he was the chief speaker.
Then the priest of Jupiter, which was
before their city, brought oxen and
garlands unto the gates, and would
have done sacrifice with the people.
Which when the apostles, Barnabas
and Paul, heard of, they rent their
clothes, and scarce restrained they
the people, that they had not done
sacrifice unto them. And they departed
to Derbe. And when they had
preached the gospel to that city, and
had taught many, they returned again
to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,
confirming the souls of the disciples,
and exhorting them to continue
in the faith, and that we must
through much tribulation enter into
the kingdom of God. And when they
had ordained them elders in every
church, and had prayed with fasting,
they commended them to the Lord,
on whom they believed. And after
they had passed throughout Pisidia,
they came to Pamphylia. And when
they had preached the word in Perga,
they went down into Attalia: and
thence sailed to Antioch, from whence
they had been recommended to the
grace of God for the work which they
fulfilled. And when they were come,
and had gathered the church together,
they rehearsed all that God
had done with them, and how he had
opened the door of faith unto the
Gentiles. And there they abode long
time with the disciples. And Paul
said unto Barnabas, Let us go again
and visit our brethren in every city
where we have preached the word of
the Lord, and see how they do. And
Barnabas determined to take with
them John, whose surname was
Mark. But Paul thought not good to
take him with them. And the contention
was so sharp between them, that
they departed asunder one from the
other: and so Barnabas took Mark,
and sailed unto Cyprus; and Paul
chose Silas, and departed, being recommended
by the brethren unto the
grace of God. And he went through
Syria and Cilicia, confirming the
churches.</p>

<small>PAUL AND SILAS IMPRISONED</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 16</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW when they had gone
throughout Phrygia and the
region of Galatia, they came
down to Troas. And a vision appeared
to Paul in the night; There
stood a man of Macedonia, and
prayed him, saying, Come over into
Macedonia, and help us. And after
he had seen the vision, immediately
we endeavoured to go into Macedonia,
assuredly gathering that the
Lord had called us for to preach the
gospel unto them. Therefore loosing
from Troas, we came with a straight
course to Samothracia, and the next
day to Neapolis; and from thence to
Philippi, which is the chief city of
that part of Macedonia, and a colony:
and we were in that city abiding certain
days. And on the sabbath we
went out of the city by a river side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
where prayer was wont to be made;
and we sat down, and spake unto the
women which resorted thither.</div>

<p>And a certain woman named
Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city
of Thyatira, which worshipped God,
heard us: whose heart the Lord
opened, that she attended unto the
things which were spoken of Paul.
And when she was baptized, and her
household, she besought us, saying,
If ye have judged me to be faithful
to the Lord, come into my house, and
abide there. And she constrained us.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, as we went to
prayer, a certain damsel possessed
with a spirit of divination met us,
which brought her masters much gain
by soothsaying: the same followed
Paul and us, and cried, saying, These
men are the servants of the most high
God, which shew unto us the way of
salvation. And this did she many
days. But Paul, being grieved,
turned and said to the spirit, I command
thee in the name of Jesus
Christ to come out of her. And he
came out the same hour. And when
her masters saw that the hope of their
gains was gone, they caught Paul
and Silas, and drew them into the
marketplace unto the rulers, and
brought them to the magistrates, saying,
These men, being Jews, do exceedingly
trouble our city, and teach
customs, which are not lawful for us
to receive, neither to observe, being
Romans. And the multitude rose up
together against them: and the magistrates
rent off their clothes, and
commanded to beat them. And when
they had laid many stripes upon
them, they cast them into prison,
charging the jailor to keep them
safely: who, having received such a
charge, thrust them into the inner
prison, and made their feet fast in
the stocks.</p>

<p>And at midnight Paul and Silas
prayed, and sang praises unto God:
and the prisoners heard them. And
suddenly there was a great earthquake,
so that the foundations of the
prison were shaken: and immediately
all the doors were opened, and every
one's bands were loosed. And the
keeper of the prison awaking out of
his sleep, and seeing the prison doors
open, he drew out his sword, and
would have killed himself, supposing
that the prisoners had been fled.
But Paul cried with a loud voice,
saying, Do thyself no harm: for we
are all here. Then he called for a
light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
and fell down before Paul and
Silas, and brought them out, and said,
Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
And they said, Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,
and thy house. And they spake unto
him the word of the Lord, and to all
that were in his house. And he took
them the same hour of the night, and
washed their stripes; and was baptized,
he and all his, straightway.
And when he had brought them into
his house, he set meat before them,
and rejoiced, believing in God with
all his house. And when it was day,
the magistrates sent the serjeants,
saying, Let those men go. And the
keeper of the prison told this saying
to Paul, The magistrates have sent
to let you go: now therefore depart,
and go in peace. But Paul said unto
them, They have beaten us openly
uncondemned, being Romans, and
have cast us into prison; and now do
they thrust us out privily? nay verily;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
but let them come themselves
and fetch us out. And the serjeants
told these words unto the magistrates:
and they feared, when they
heard that they were Romans. And
they came and besought them, and
brought them out, and desired them
to depart out of the city. And they
went out of the prison, and entered
into the house of Lydia: and when
they had seen the brethren, they comforted
them, and departed.</p>

<small>PAUL PREACHES AT THESSALONICA,
ATHENS, AND CORINTH</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 17</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW when they had passed
through Amphipolis and Apollonia,
they came to Thessalonica,
where was a synagogue of
the Jews: and Paul, as his manner
was, went in unto them, and three
sabbath days reasoned with them out
of the scriptures, opening and alleging,
that Christ must needs have suffered,
and risen again from the dead;
and that this Jesus, whom I preach
unto you, is Christ. And some of
them believed, and consorted with
Paul and Silas; and of the devout
Greeks a great multitude, and of the
chief women not a few.</div>

<p>But the Jews which believed not,
moved with envy, took unto them
certain fellows of the baser sort, and
gathered a company, and set all the
city on an uproar, and assaulted the
house of Jason, and sought to bring
them out to the people. And when
they found them not, they drew Jason
and certain brethren unto the
rulers of the city, crying, These that
have turned the world upside down
are come hither also; whom Jason
hath received: and these all do contrary
to the decrees of Cæsar, saying
that there is another king, one Jesus.
And they troubled the people and the
rulers of the city, when they heard
these things.</p>

<p>And the brethren immediately sent
away Paul and Silas by night unto
Berea: who coming thither went into
the synagogue of the Jews. These
were more noble than those in Thessalonica,
in that they received the
word with all readiness of mind, and
searched the scriptures daily, whether
those things were so. Therefore
many of them believed; also
of honourable women which were
Greeks, and of men, not a few. But
when the Jews of Thessalonica had
knowledge that the word of God was
preached of Paul at Berea, they came
thither also, and stirred up the people.
And then immediately the brethren
sent away Paul to go as it were
to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus
abode there still. And they that conducted
Paul brought him unto
Athens: and receiving a commandment
unto Silas and Timotheus for
to come to him with all speed, they
departed.</p>

<p>Now while Paul waited for them
at Athens, his spirit was stirred in
him, when he saw the city wholly
given to idolatry. Then Paul stood
in the midst of Mars' hill, and said,
Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in
all things ye are too superstitious.
For as I passed by, and beheld your
devotions, I found an altar with this
inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN
GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
worship, him declare I unto
you. God that made the world and
all things therein, seeing that he is
Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth
not in temples made with hands;
neither is worshipped with men's
hands, as though he needed any
thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and
breath, and all things; and hath
made of one blood all nations of men
for to dwell on all the face of the
earth, and hath determined the times
before appointed, and the bounds of
their habitation; that they should
seek the Lord, if haply they might
feel after him, and find him, though
he be not far from every one of us:
for in him we live, and move, and
have our being; as certain also of
your own poets have said, For we
are also his offspring. Forasmuch
then as we are the offspring of God,
we ought not to think that the Godhead
is like unto gold, or silver, or
stone, graven by art and man's device.
And the times of this ignorance
God winked at; but now commandeth
all men every where to
repent: because he hath appointed
a day, in the which he will judge
the world in righteousness by that
man whom he hath ordained; whereof
he hath given assurance unto
all men, in that he hath raised him
from the dead.</p>

<p>And when they heard of the resurrection
of the dead, some mocked:
and others said, We will hear thee
again of this matter. So Paul departed
from among them. Howbeit
certain men clave unto him, and believed:
among the which was Dionysius
the Areopagite, and a woman
named Damaris, and others with
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Acts 18</div>

<p>After these things Paul departed
from Athens, and came to Corinth;
and found a certain Jew named
Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come
from Italy, with his wife Priscilla;
(because that Claudius had commanded
all Jews to depart from
Rome:) and came unto them. And
because he was of the same craft, he
abode with them, and wrought: for
by their occupation they were tentmakers.
And he reasoned in the
synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded
the Jews and the Greeks.
And when Silas and Timotheus were
come from Macedonia, Paul was
pressed in the spirit, and testified
to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.
And when they opposed themselves,
and blasphemed, he shook his raiment,
and said unto them, Your blood
be upon your own heads; I am clean:
from henceforth I will go unto the
Gentiles. Then spake the Lord to
Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
afraid, but speak, and hold not thy
peace: for I am with thee, and no
man shall set on thee to hurt thee:
for I have much people in this city.
And he continued there a year and
six months, teaching the word of God
among them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_79_2" id="CHAPTER_79_2">CHAPTER 79</a><br />

<small>GALLIO</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND when Gallio was the deputy
of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection
with one accord
against Paul, and brought him to the
judgment seat, saying, This fellow
persuadeth men to worship God contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
to the law. And when Paul
was now about to open his mouth,
Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were
a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness,
O ye Jews, reason would that I
should bear with you: but if it be a
question of words and names, and of
your law, look ye to it; for I will be
no judge of such matters. And he
drave them from the judgment seat.
Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes,
the chief ruler of the synagogue, and
beat him before the judgment seat.
And Gallio cared for none of those
things.</div>

<p>And Paul after this tarried there
yet a good while, and then took his
leave of the brethren, and sailed
thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla
and Aquila. And he came to
Ephesus, and left them there: but he
himself entered into the synagogue,
and reasoned with the Jews. And
God wrought special miracles by the
hands of Paul: and many that believed
came, and confessed, and
shewed their deeds. Many of them
also which used curious arts brought
their books together, and burned
them before all men: and they
counted the price of them, and found
it fifty thousand pieces of silver. So
mightily grew the word of God and
prevailed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_80_2" id="CHAPTER_80_2">CHAPTER 80</a><br />

<small>A PART OF THE FIRST EPISTLE
OF PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Corinthians 1-10</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>PAUL, called to be an apostle
of Jesus Christ through the
will of God, unto the church
of God which is at Corinth, to them
that are sanctified in Christ Jesus,
called to be saints, with all that in
every place call upon the name of
Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's
and our's: grace be unto you, and
peace, from God our Father, and
from the Lord Jesus Christ. God is
faithful, by whom ye were called
unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord. Now I beseech
you, brethren, by the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak
the same thing, and that there be no
divisions among you; but that ye be
perfectly joined together in the same
mind and in the same judgment. For
it hath been declared unto me of you,
my brethren, by them which are of
the house of Chloe, that there are
contentions among you. Now this I
say, that every one of you saith, I am
of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of
Cephas; and I of Christ. Is Christ
divided? was Paul crucified for you?
or were ye baptized in the name of
Paul? Eye hath not seen, nor ear
heard, neither have entered into the
heart of man, the things which God
hath prepared for them that love
him. Who is Paul, and who is Apollos,
but ministers by whom ye believed,
even as the Lord gave to
every man? I have planted, Apollos
watered; but God gave the increase.
So then neither is he that planteth
any thing, neither he that watereth;
but God that giveth the increase.
For we are labourers together with
God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are
God's building. For other foundation
can no man lay than that is laid,
which is Jesus Christ. Know ye not
that ye are the temple of God, and
that the Spirit of God dwelleth in
you? If any man defile the temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
of God, him shall God destroy; for
the temple of God is holy, which temple
ye are. Therefore let no man
glory in men. For all things are
your's; whether Paul, or Apollos, or
Cephas, or the world, or life, or
death, or things present, or things
to come; all are your's; and ye are
Christ's; and Christ is God's. Whether
therefore ye eat, or drink, or
whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory
of God.</div>

<p>Though I speak with the tongues
of men and of angels, and have not
charity, I am become as sounding
brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And
though I have the gift of prophecy,
and understand all mysteries, and all
knowledge; and though I have all
faith, so that I could remove mountains,
and have not charity, I am
nothing. And though I bestow all
my goods to feed the poor, and
though I give my body to be burned,
and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing. Charity suffereth long, and
is kind; charity envieth not; charity
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
doth not behave itself unseemly,
seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,
thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not
in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
beareth all things, believeth all
things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things. Charity never faileth:
but whether there be prophecies,
they shall fail; whether there be
tongues, they shall cease; whether
there be knowledge, it shall vanish
away. For we know in part, and we
prophesy in part. But when that
which is perfect is come, then that
which is in part shall be done away.
When I was a child, I spake as a
child, I understood as a child, I
thought as a child: but when I became
a man, I put away childish
things. For now we see through a
glass, darkly; but then face to face:
now I know in part; but then shall I
know even as also I am known. And
now abideth faith, hope, charity,
these three; but the greatest of these
is charity.</p>

<p>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto
you the gospel which I preached
unto you, which also ye have received,
and wherein ye stand. For
I delivered unto you first of all that
which I also received, how that Christ
died for our sins according to the
scriptures; and that he was buried,
and that he rose again the third day
according to the scriptures: and that
he was seen of Cephas, then of the
twelve: after that, he was seen of
above five hundred brethren at once;
of whom the greater part remain unto
this present, but some are fallen
asleep. After that, he was seen of
James; then of all the apostles. And
last of all he was seen of me also, as
of one born out of due time. For I
am the least of the apostles, that am
not meet to be called an apostle, because
I persecuted the church of God.
But by the grace of God I am what
I am: and his grace which was bestowed
upon me was not in vain; but
I laboured more abundantly than
they all: yet not I, but the grace of
God which was with me.</p>

<p>Now if Christ be preached that
he rose from the dead, how say
some among you that there is no
resurrection of the dead? But if
there be no resurrection of the dead,
then is Christ not risen: and if
Christ be not raised, your faith
is vain; ye are yet in your sins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
Then they also which are fallen
asleep in Christ are perished. If in
this life only we have hope in Christ,
we are of all men most miserable.
But now is Christ risen from the
dead, and become the firstfruits of
them that slept. For since by man
came death, by man came also the
resurrection of the dead. For as in
Adam all die, even so in Christ shall
all be made alive. But every man in
his own order: Christ the firstfruits;
afterward they that are Christ's at
his coming. Then cometh the end,
when he shall have delivered up the
kingdom to God, even the Father;
when he shall have put down all rule
and all authority and power. For he
must reign, till he hath put all enemies
under his feet. The last enemy
that shall be destroyed is death.</p>

<p>But some man will say, How are
the dead raised up? and with what
body do they come? Thou fool, that
which thou sowest is not quickened,
except it die: and that which thou
sowest, thou sowest not that body that
shall be, but bare grain, it may
chance of wheat, or of some other
grain: but God giveth it a body as it
hath pleased him, and to every seed
his own body. There is one glory of
the sun, and another glory of the
moon, and another glory of the stars:
for one star differeth from another
star in glory. So also is the resurrection
of the dead. It is sown in
corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
it is sown in dishonour; it is
raised in glory: it is sown in weakness;
it is raised in power: it is sown
a natural body; it is raised a spiritual
body. There is a natural body, and
there is a spiritual body. And as we
have borne the image of the earthy,
we shall also bear the image of the
heavenly. Now this I say, brethren,
that flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God; neither doth
corruption inherit incorruption. For
this corruptible must put on incorruption,
and this mortal must put on
immortality. So when this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption,
and this mortal shall have put on immortality,
then shall be brought to
pass the saying that is written, Death
is swallowed up in victory. O death,
where is thy sting? O grave, where
is thy victory? The sting of death
is sin; and the strength of sin is the
law. But thanks be to God, which
giveth us the victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<small>DIANA OF THE EPHESIANS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 19</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AFTER these things Paul purposed
in the spirit, when he
had passed through Macedonia
and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem,
saying, After I have been there, I
must also see Rome. So he sent into
Macedonia two of them that ministered
unto him, Timotheus and Erastus;
but he himself stayed in Asia for
a season. And the same time there
arose no small stir about that way.
For a certain man named Demetrius,
a silversmith, which made silver
shrines for Diana, brought no small
gain unto the craftsmen; whom he
called together with the workmen of
like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye
know that by this craft we have our
wealth. Moreover ye see and hear,
that not alone at Ephesus, but almost
throughout all Asia, this Paul hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
persuaded and turned away much
people, saying that they be no gods,
which are made with hands: so that
not only this our craft is in danger
to be set at nought; but also that the
temple of the great goddess Diana
should be despised, and her magnificence
should be destroyed, whom all
Asia and the world worshippeth.
And when they heard these sayings,
they were full of wrath, and cried
out, saying, Great is Diana of the
Ephesians.</div>

<p>And the whole city was filled with
confusion: and having caught Gaius
and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia,
Paul's companions in travel, they
rushed with one accord into the theatre.
And when Paul would have entered
in unto the people, the disciples
suffered him not. And certain
of the chief of Asia, which were his
friends, sent unto him, desiring him
that he would not adventure himself
into the theatre. Some therefore
cried one thing, and some another:
for the assembly was confused; and
the more part knew not wherefore
they were come together. And when
the townclerk had appeased the people,
he dismissed the assembly. And
after the uproar was ceased, Paul
called unto him the disciples, and embraced
them, and departed for to go
into Macedonia.</p>

<small>A PART OF THE SECOND EPISTLE
OF PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">II. Cor. 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>PAUL, an apostle of Jesus
Christ by the will of God, and
Timothy our brother, unto
the church of God which is at Corinth,
with all the saints which are in
all Achaia: grace be to you and peace
from God our Father, and from the
Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be God,
even the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Father of mercies, and the
God of all comfort; who comforteth
us in all our tribulation, that we may
be able to comfort them which are in
any trouble, by the comfort wherewith
we ourselves are comforted of
God. For our light affliction, which
is but for a moment, worketh for us
a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory; while we look not at
the things which are seen, but at the
things which are not seen: for the
things which are seen are temporal;
but the things which are not seen are
eternal. For we know that if our
earthly house of this tabernacle were
dissolved, we have a building of God,
an house not made with hands, eternal
in the heavens. Therefore we
are always confident, knowing that,
whilst we are at home in the body, we
are absent from the Lord: (for we
walk by faith, not by sight:) we are
confident, I say, and willing rather
to be absent from the body, and to be
present with the Lord. Wherefore
we labour, that, whether present or
absent, we may be accepted of him.
For we must all appear before the
judgment seat of Christ; that every
one may receive the things done in
his body, according to that he hath
done, whether it be good or bad. For
the love of Christ constraineth us;
because we thus judge, that if one
died for all, then were all dead: and
that he died for all, that they which
live should not henceforth live unto
themselves, but unto him which died
for them, and rose again. Therefore
if any man be in Christ, he is a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
creature: old things are passed away;
behold, all things are become new.
And all things are of God, who hath
reconciled us to himself by Jesus
Christ, and hath given to us the ministry
of reconciliation; to wit, that
God was in Christ, reconciling the
world unto himself, not imputing
their trespasses unto them. Now
then we are ambassadors for Christ,
as though God did beseech you by
us: we pray you in Christ's stead,
be ye reconciled to God. For he
hath made him to be sin for us,
who knew no sin; that we might
be made the righteousness of God
in him.</div>

<p>We then, as workers together with
him, beseech you also that ye receive
not the grace of God in vain. (For
he saith, I have heard thee in a time
accepted, and in the day of salvation
have I succoured thee: behold, now
is the accepted time; behold, now is
the day of salvation.) Giving no offence
in any thing, that the ministry
be not blamed: but in all things approving
ourselves as the ministers
of God, in much patience, in afflictions,
in necessities, in distresses, in
stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults,
in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
by pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering,
by kindness, by the Holy
Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the
word of truth, by the power of God,
by the armour of righteousness on
the right hand and on the left, by
honour and dishonour, by evil report
and good report: as deceivers,
and yet true; as unknown, and yet
well known; as dying, and, behold,
we live; as chastened, and not killed;
as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as
poor, yet making many rich; as having
nothing, and yet possessing all
things.</p>

<p>Having therefore these promises,
dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves
from all filthiness of the flesh
and spirit, perfecting holiness in the
fear of God. For ye know the grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though
he was rich, yet for your sakes he became
poor, that ye through his poverty
might be rich. He which soweth
sparingly shall reap also sparingly;
and he which soweth bountifully shall
reap also bountifully. Every man
according as he purposeth in his
heart, so let him give; not grudgingly,
or of necessity: for God loveth
a cheerful giver. And God is able
to make all grace abound toward you;
that ye, always having all sufficiency
in all things, may abound to every
good work.</p>

<span class='location'>A PART OF THE EPISTLE OF PAUL
TO THE GALATIANS</span></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Galatians 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>PAUL, an apostle, (not of men,
neither by man, but by Jesus
Christ, and God the Father,
who raised him from the dead;) and
all the brethren which are with me,
unto the churches of Galatia: grace
be to you and peace from God the
Father, and from our Lord Jesus
Christ, who gave himself for our sins,
that he might deliver us from this
present evil world, according to the
will of God and our Father.</div>

<p>Christ hath redeemed us from the
curse of the law, being made a curse
for us: for it is written, Cursed is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
every one that hangeth on a tree: that
the blessing of Abraham might come
on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ;
that we might receive the promise of
the Spirit through faith. For ye are
all the children of God by faith in
Christ Jesus. For as many of you as
have been baptized into Christ have
put on Christ. There is neither Jew
nor Greek, there is neither bond nor
free, there is neither male nor female:
for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
And if ye be Christ's, then are
ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according
to the promise. This I say then,
Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not
fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the
flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and
the Spirit against the flesh: and these
are contrary the one to the other: so
that ye cannot do the things that ye
would. But the fruit of the Spirit
is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
temperance: against such there is no
law. And they that are Christ's have
crucified the flesh with the affections
and lusts. If we live in the Spirit,
let us also walk in the Spirit.</p>

<p>Let us not be desirous of vain
glory, provoking one another, envying
one another. Bear ye one another's
burdens, and so fulfil the law
of Christ. Be not deceived; God is
not mocked: for whatsoever a man
soweth, that shall he also reap. For
he that soweth to his flesh shall of
the flesh reap corruption; but he that
soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit
reap life everlasting. And let us not
be weary in well doing: for in due
season we shall reap, if we faint not.
As we have therefore opportunity,
let us do good unto all men, especially
unto them who are of the household
of faith. God forbid that I should
glory, save in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom the world is
crucified unto me, and I unto the
world. For in Christ Jesus neither
circumcision availeth any thing, nor
uncircumcision, but a new creature.
Brethren, the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Amen.</p>

<small>A PART OF THE EPISTLE OF PAUL
TO THE ROMANS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Romans 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>PAUL, a servant of Jesus
Christ, to all that be in Rome,
beloved of God, called to be
saints: Grace to you and peace from
God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
Christ. As much as in me is, I am
ready to preach the gospel to you that
are at Rome also. For I am not
ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for
it is the power of God unto salvation
to every one that believeth; to the
Jew first, and also to the Greek. For
therein is the righteousness of God
revealed from faith to faith: as it is
written, The just shall live by faith.
There is no respect of persons with
God. For as many as have sinned
without law shall also perish without
law: and as many as have sinned in
the law shall be judged by the law;
in the day when God shall judge the
secrets of men by Jesus Christ according
to my gospel. Now we know
that what things soever the law saith,
it saith to them who are under the
law: that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may become
guilty before God. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
by the deeds of the law there shall
no flesh be justified in his sight: for
by the law is the knowledge of sin.
But now the righteousness of God
without the law is manifested, being
witnessed by the law and the prophets;
even the righteousness of God
which is by faith of Jesus Christ
unto all and upon all them that believe:
for there is no difference: for
all have sinned, and come short of
the glory of God; being justified
freely by his grace through the redemption
that is in Christ Jesus.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Romans 5</div>

<p>Therefore being justified by faith,
we have peace with God through our
Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we
have access by faith into this grace
wherein we stand, and rejoice in
hope of the glory of God. And not
only so, but we glory in tribulations
also: knowing that tribulation worketh
patience; and patience, experience;
and experience, hope: and hope
maketh not ashamed; because the
love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
given unto us. For when we were yet
without strength, in due time Christ
died for the ungodly. For scarcely
for a righteous man will one die: yet
peradventure for a good man some
would even dare to die. But God
commendeth his love toward us, in
that, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us. Wherefore, as
by one man sin entered into the
world, and death by sin; so death
passed upon all men, for that all have
sinned. As by one man's disobedience
many were made sinners, so by
the obedience of one shall many be
made righteous. Let not sin therefore
reign in your mortal body, that
ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
Know ye not, that to whom ye yield
yourselves servants to obey, his servants
ye are to whom ye obey; whether
of sin unto death, or of obedience
unto righteousness? But now
being made free from sin, and become
servants to God, ye have your fruit
unto holiness, and the end everlasting
life. For the wages of sin is
death; but the gift of God is eternal
life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>There is therefore now no condemnation
to them which are in Christ
Jesus, who walk not after the flesh,
but after the Spirit. For to be carnally
minded is death; but to be spiritually
minded is life and peace.
Because the carnal mind is enmity
against God: for it is not subject to
the law of God, neither indeed can
be. But ye are not in the flesh, but in
the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of
God dwell in you. Now if any man
have not the Spirit of Christ, he is
none of his. For as many as are led
by the Spirit of God, they are the
sons of God. The Spirit itself beareth
witness with our spirit, that we
are the children of God: and if children,
then heirs; heirs of God, and
joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that
we suffer with him, that we may be
also glorified together. For I reckon
that the sufferings of this present
time are not worthy to be compared
with the glory which shall be revealed
in us. And we know that all things
work together for good to them that
love God, to them who are the called
according to his purpose. He that
spared not his own Son, but delivered
him up for us all, how shall he
not with him also freely give us all
things?</p>

<p>Who shall lay any thing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
charge of God's elect? It is God that
justifieth. Who is he that condemneth?
It is Christ that died, yea
rather, that is risen again, who is
even at the right hand of God, who
also maketh intercession for us. Who
shall separate us from the love of
Christ? shall tribulation, or distress,
or persecution, or famine, or nakedness,
or peril, or sword? Nay, in all
these things we are more than conquerors
through him that loved us.
For I am persuaded, that neither
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
nor powers, nor things
present, nor things to come, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature,
shall be able to separate us from
the love of God, which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p>I beseech you therefore, brethren,
by the mercies of God, that ye present
your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
acceptable unto God, which is your
reasonable service. Let love be without
dissimulation. Abhor that which
is evil; cleave to that which is good.
Be kindly affectioned one to another
with brotherly love; in honour preferring
one another; not slothful in
business; fervent in spirit; serving
the Lord; rejoicing in hope; patient
in tribulation; continuing instant in
prayer; distributing to the necessity
of saints; given to hospitality.</p>

<p>Bless them which persecute you:
bless, and curse not. Rejoice with
them that do rejoice, and weep with
them that weep. Be of the same mind
one toward another. Mind not high
things, but condescend to men of low
estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
Recompense to no man evil for
evil. Provide things honest in the
sight of all men. If it be possible, as
much as lieth in you, live peaceably
with all men. Dearly beloved, avenge
not yourselves, but rather give place
unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance
is mine; I will repay, saith
the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy
hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give
him drink: for in so doing thou shalt
heap coals of fire on his head. Be
not overcome of evil, but overcome
evil with good. Owe no man any
thing, but to love one another. Love
worketh no ill to his neighbour:
therefore love is the fulfilling of the
law. For none of us liveth to himself,
and no man dieth to himself.
For whether we live, we live unto the
Lord; and whether we die, we die
unto the Lord: whether we live therefore,
or die, we are the Lord's. For
to this end Christ both died, and rose,
and revived, that he might be Lord
both of the dead and living. But why
dost thou judge thy brother? or why
dost thou set at nought thy brother?
for we shall all stand before the judgment
seat of Christ. Let not then
your good be evil spoken of: for the
kingdom of God is not meat and
drink; but righteousness, and peace,
and joy in the Holy Ghost. Now the
God of peace be with you all. Amen.</p>

<small>EUTYCHUS&mdash;THE ELDERS OF
EPHESUS</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The Acts 20</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND when the Jews laid wait for
Paul, as he was about to sail
into Syria, he purposed to return
through Macedonia. And we
sailed away from Philippi after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
days of unleavened bread, and came
to Troas, where we abode seven days.
And upon the first day of the week,
when the disciples came together to
break bread, Paul preached unto
them, ready to depart on the morrow;
and continued his speech until midnight.
And there were many lights
in the upper chamber, where they
were gathered together. And there
sat in a window a certain young man
named Eutychus, being fallen into a
deep sleep: and as Paul was long
preaching, he sunk down with sleep,
and fell down from the third loft, and
was taken up dead. And Paul went
down, and fell on him, and embracing
him said, Trouble not yourselves; for
his life is in him. When he therefore
was come up again, and had broken
bread, and eaten, and talked a long
while, even till break of day, so
he departed. And they brought the
young man alive, and were not a little
comforted.</div>

<p>And we went before to ship, and
sailed unto Assos, there intending to
take in Paul: for so had he appointed,
minding himself to go afoot. And
when he met with us at Assos, we took
him in, and came to Miletus. And
from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and
called the elders of the church. And
when they were come to him, he said
unto them, Ye know, from the first
day that I came into Asia, after what
manner I have been with you at all
seasons, serving the Lord with all humility
of mind, and with many tears,
and temptations, which befell me by
the lying in wait of the Jews: and
how I kept back nothing that was
profitable unto you, but have shewed
you, and have taught you publickly,
and from house to house, testifying
both to the Jews, and also to the
Greeks, repentance toward God, and
faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
And now, behold, I go bound in the
spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing
the things that shall befall me there:
save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth
in every city, saying that bonds and
afflictions abide me.</p>

<p>But none of these things move me,
neither count I my life dear unto myself,
so that I might finish my course
with joy, and the ministry, which I
have received of the Lord Jesus, to
testify the gospel of the grace of God.
And now, behold, I know that ye all,
among whom I have gone preaching
the kingdom of God, shall see my
face no more. Wherefore I take you
to record this day, that I am pure
from the blood of all men. For I
have not shunned to declare unto you
all the counsel of God. And now,
brethren, I commend you to God, and
to the word of his grace. I have coveted
no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.
Yea, ye yourselves know, that
these hands have ministered unto my
necessities, and to them that were
with me. I have shewed you all
things, how that so labouring ye
ought to support the weak, and to remember
the words of the Lord Jesus,
how he said, It is more blessed to give
than to receive.</p>

<p>And when he had thus spoken, he
kneeled down, and prayed with them
all. And they all wept sore, and fell
on Paul's neck, and kissed him, sorrowing
most of all for the words
which he spake, that they should see
his face no more. And they accompanied
him unto the ship.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_86_2" id="CHAPTER_86_2">CHAPTER 86</a><br />

<small>PAUL GOES UP TO JERUSALEM</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 21</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND it came to pass, that after
we were gotten from them,
and had launched, we came
with a straight course unto Patara:
and finding a ship sailing over unto
Phenicia, we went aboard, and set
forth, and landed at Tyre: for there
the ship was to unlade her burden.
And when we were come to Jerusalem,
the brethren received us gladly.
And the day following Paul went in
with us unto James; and all the elders
were present. And when he had
saluted them, he declared particularly
what things God had wrought
among the Gentiles by his ministry.</div>

<p>And Paul and the men that were
with him went into the temple. And
the Jews which were of Asia, when
they saw him in the temple, stirred
up all the people, and laid hands on
him. And all the city was moved,
and the people ran together: and
they took Paul, and drew him out of
the temple: and forthwith the doors
were shut. And as they went about
to kill him, tidings came unto the
chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem
was in an uproar. Who immediately
took soldiers and centurions,
and ran down unto them: and
when they saw the chief captain
and the soldiers, they left beating of
Paul. Then the chief captain came
near, and took him, and commanded
him to be bound with two chains; and
demanded who he was, and what he
had done. And some cried one thing,
some another, among the multitude:
and when he could not know the certainty
for the tumult, he commanded
him to be carried into the castle. And
when he came upon the stairs, so it
was, that he was borne of the soldiers
for the violence of the people. For
the multitude of the people followed
after, crying, Away with him. And
as Paul was to be led into the castle,
he said unto the chief captain, I beseech
thee, suffer me to speak unto
the people. And when he had given
him licence, Paul stood on the stairs,
and beckoned with the hand unto the
people. And when there was made a
great silence, he spake unto them in
the Hebrew tongue, and declared to
them how he was converted to the
faith of Christ, and that he was sent
to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.</p>

<p>And they gave him audience unto
this word, and then lifted up their
voices, and said, Away with such a
fellow from the earth: for it is not
fit that he should live. And as they
cried out, and cast off their clothes,
and threw dust into the air, the
chief captain commanded him to be
brought into the castle, and bade that
he should be examined by scourging;
that he might know wherefore they
cried so against him. And as they
bound him with thongs, Paul said
unto the centurion that stood by, Is
it lawful for you to scourge a man
that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
When the centurion heard that, he
went and told the chief captain, saying,
Take heed what thou doest: for
this man is a Roman. Then the chief
captain came, and said unto him, Tell
me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
And the chief captain answered, With
a great sum obtained I this freedom.
And Paul said, But I was free born.
Then straightway they departed from
him which should have examined
him: and the chief captain also was
afraid, after he knew that he was a
Roman, and because he had bound
him. On the morrow, because he
would have known the certainty
wherefore he was accused of the
Jews, he loosed him from his bands,
and commanded the chief priests and
all their council to appear, and
brought Paul down, and set him before
them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_87_2" id="CHAPTER_87_2">CHAPTER 87</a><br />

<small>PAUL SENT UNTO FELIX</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 23</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND Paul, earnestly beholding
the council, said, Men and
brethren, I have lived in all
good conscience before God until this
day. And the high priest Ananias
commanded them that stood by him
to smite him on the mouth. Then
said Paul unto him, God shall smite
thee, thou whited wall: for sittest
thou to judge me after the law, and
commandest me to be smitten contrary
to the law? And they that
stood by said, Revilest thou God's
high priest? Then said Paul, I wist
not, brethren, that he was the high
priest: for it is written, Thou shalt
not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
And when there arose a great
dissension, the chief captain, fearing
lest Paul should have been pulled in
pieces of them, commanded the soldiers
to go down, and to take him by
force from among them, and to bring
him into the castle. And the night
following the Lord stood by him, and
said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as
thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem,
so must thou bear witness also at
Rome.</div>

<p>And when it was day, certain of
the Jews banded together, and bound
themselves under a curse, saying that
they would neither eat nor drink
till they had killed Paul. And they
came to the chief priests and elders,
and said, We have bound ourselves
under a great curse, that we will eat
nothing until we have slain Paul.
And when Paul's sister's son heard
of their lying in wait, he went and
entered into the castle, and told Paul.
Then Paul called one of the centurions
unto him, and said, Bring this
young man unto the chief captain:
for he hath a certain thing to tell him.
So he took him, and brought him to
the chief captain. Then the chief
captain took him by the hand, and
went with him aside privately, and
asked him, What is that thou hast to
tell me? And he said, The Jews have
agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest
bring down Paul to morrow into
the council, as though they would enquire
somewhat of him more perfectly.
But do not thou yield unto
them: for there lie in wait for him
more than forty men, which have
bound themselves with an oath, that
they will neither eat nor drink till
they have killed him. So the chief
captain then let the young man depart,
and charged him, See thou tell
no man that thou hast shewed these
things to me. And he called unto him
two centurions, saying, Make ready
two hundred soldiers to go to Cæsarea,
and horsemen threescore and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
ten, and spearmen two hundred, at
the third hour of the night; and provide
them beasts, that they may set
Paul on, and bring him safe unto
Felix the governor. And he wrote
a letter after this manner:</p>

<p>Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent
governor Felix sendeth greeting.
This man was taken of the
Jews, and should have been killed
of them: then came I with an army,
and rescued him, having understood
that he was a Roman. And when I
would have known the cause wherefore
they accused him, I brought him
forth into their council: whom I perceived
to be accused of questions of
their law, but to have nothing laid to
his charge worthy of death or of
bonds. And when it was told me how
that the Jews laid wait for the man,
I sent straightway to thee, and gave
commandment to his accusers also to
say before thee what they had against
him. Farewell.</p>

<p>Then the soldiers, as it was commanded
them, took Paul, and brought
him by night to Antipatris. On the
morrow they left the horsemen to go
with him, who, when they came to
Cæsarea, and delivered the epistle
to the governor, presented Paul also
before him. And when the governor
had read the letter, he asked of what
province he was. And when he understood
that he was of Cilicia; I
will hear thee, said he, when thine
accusers are also come. And he commanded
him to be kept in Herod's
judgment hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Acts 24</div>

<p>And after five days Ananias the
high priest descended with the elders,
and with a certain orator named Tertullus,
who informed the governor
against Paul. And when he was
called forth, Tertullus began to accuse
him, saying, We have found
this man a pestilent fellow, and a
mover of sedition among all the Jews
throughout the world, and a ringleader
of the sect of the Nazarenes:
who also hath gone about to profane
the temple: whom we took, and would
have judged according to our law.
But the chief captain Lysias came
upon us, and with great violence took
him away out of our hands, commanding
his accusers to come unto
thee: by examining of whom thyself
mayest take knowledge of all these
things, whereof we accuse him. And
the Jews also assented, saying that
these things were so.</p>

<p>Then Paul, after that the governor
had beckoned unto him to speak, answered,
Forasmuch as I know that
thou hast been of many years a judge
unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully
answer for myself: because that
thou mayest understand, that there
are yet but twelve days since I went
up to Jerusalem for to worship. And
they neither found me in the temple
disputing with any man, neither raising
up the people, neither in the synagogues,
nor in the city. But this I
confess unto thee, that after the way
which they call heresy, so worship I
the God of my fathers, believing all
things which are written in the law
and in the prophets: and have hope
toward God, which they themselves
also allow, that there shall be a resurrection
of the dead, both of the just
and unjust. And herein do I exercise
myself, to have always a conscience
void of offence toward God, and toward
men.</p>

<p>And when Felix heard these
things, having more perfect knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
of that way, he deferred them,
and said, When Lysias the chief captain
shall come down, I will know the
uttermost of your matter. And he
commanded a centurion to keep Paul,
and to let him have liberty, and that
he should forbid none of his acquaintance
to minister or come unto him.
And after certain days, when Felix
came with his wife Drusilla, which
was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and
heard him concerning the faith in
Christ. And as he reasoned of righteousness,
temperance, and judgment
to come, Felix trembled, and answered,
Go thy way for this time;
when I have a convenient season, I
will call for thee. He hoped also that
money should have been given him
of Paul, that he might loose him:
wherefore he sent for him the oftener,
and communed with him. But after
two years Porcius Festus came into
Felix' room: and Felix, willing to
shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul
bound.</p>

<small>PAUL ACCUSED BEFORE FESTUS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 25</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>Now when Festus was come
into the province, after three
days he ascended from Cæsarea
to Jerusalem. Then the high
priest and the chief of the Jews informed
him against Paul, and besought
him, that he would send for
him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the
way to kill him. But Festus answered,
that Paul should be kept at
Cæsarea, and that he himself would
depart shortly thither. Let them
therefore, said he, which among you
are able, go down with me, and accuse
this man, if there be any wickedness
in him. And when he had tarried
among them more than ten days, he
went down unto Cæsarea; and the
next day sitting on the judgment seat
commanded Paul to be brought. And
when he was come, the Jews which
came down from Jerusalem stood
round about, and laid many and
grievous complaints against Paul,
which they could not prove. But
Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure,
answered Paul, and said, Wilt
thou go up to Jerusalem, and there
be judged of these things before me?
Then said Paul, I stand at Cæsar's
judgment seat, where I ought to be
judged: to the Jews have I done no
wrong, as thou very well knowest.
For if I be an offender, or have
committed any thing worthy of death,
I refuse not to die: but if there
be none of these things whereof
these accuse me, no man may deliver
me unto them. I appeal unto
Cæsar.</div>

<p>Then Festus, when he had conferred
with the council, answered,
Hast thou appealed unto Cæsar? unto
Cæsar shalt thou go.</p>

<p>And after certain days king Agrippa
and Bernice came unto Cæsarea
to salute Festus. And when they had
been there many days, Festus declared
Paul's cause unto the king.
Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I
would also hear the man myself. To
morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
And on the morrow, when Agrippa
was come, and Bernice, with great
pomp, and was entered into the place
of hearing, with the chief captains,
and principal men of the city, at Festus'
commandment Paul was brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
forth. And Festus said, King Agrippa,
and all men which are here present
with us, ye see this man, about
whom all the multitude of the Jews
have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem,
and also here, crying that he
ought not to live any longer. Of
whom I have no certain thing to write
unto my lord. Wherefore I have
brought him forth before you, and
specially before thee, O king Agrippa,
that, after examination had, I might
have somewhat to write. For it seemeth
to me unreasonable to send a prisoner,
and not withal to signify the
crimes laid against him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Acts 26</div>

<p>Then Agrippa said unto Paul,
Thou art permitted to speak for thyself.
Then Paul stretched forth the
hand, and answered for himself: I
think myself happy, king Agrippa,
because I shall answer for myself
this day before thee touching all the
things whereof I am accused of the
Jews. My manner of life from my
youth, which was at the first among
mine own nation at Jerusalem, know
all the Jews; which knew me from
the beginning, if they would testify,
that after the most straitest sect of
our religion I lived a Pharisee. And
now I stand and am judged for the
hope of the promise made of God
unto our fathers. I verily thought
with myself, that I ought to do many
things contrary to the name of Jesus
of Nazareth. Which thing I also did
in Jerusalem: and many of the saints
did I shut up in prison, having received
authority from the chief
priests; and when they were put to
death, I gave my voice against them.
And I punished them oft in every
synagogue, and compelled them to
blaspheme; and being exceedingly
mad against them, I persecuted them
even unto strange cities.</p>

<p>Whereupon as I went to Damascus
with authority and commission from
the chief priests, at midday, O king,
I saw in the way a light from heaven,
above the brightness of the sun, shining
round about me and them which
journeyed with me. And when we
were all fallen to the earth, I heard
a voice speaking unto me, and saying
in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me? it is hard
for thee to kick against the pricks.
And I said, Who art thou, Lord?
And he said, I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest. But rise, and stand
upon thy feet: for I have appeared
unto thee for this purpose, to make
thee a minister and a witness both of
these things which thou hast seen,
and of those things in the which I will
appear unto thee; delivering thee
from the people, and from the Gentiles,
unto whom now I send thee, to
open their eyes, and to turn them
from darkness to light, and from the
power of Satan unto God, that they
may receive forgiveness of sins, and
inheritance among them which are
sanctified by faith that is in me.</p>

<p>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was
not disobedient unto the heavenly
vision: but shewed first unto them
of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and
throughout all the coasts of Judæa,
and then to the Gentiles, that they
should repent and turn to God, and
do works meet for repentance. Having
therefore obtained help of God,
I continue unto this day, witnessing
both to small and great, saying none
other things than those which the prophets
and Moses did say should come:
that Christ should suffer, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
he should be the first that should rise
from the dead, and should shew light
unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</p>

<p>And as he thus spake for himself,
Festus said with a loud voice, Paul,
thou art beside thyself; much learning
doth make thee mad. But he
said, I am not mad, most noble Festus;
but speak forth the words of
truth and soberness. For the king
knoweth of these things, before whom
also I speak freely: for I am persuaded
that none of these things are
hidden from him; for this thing was
not done in a corner. King Agrippa,
believest thou the prophets? I know
that thou believest. Then Agrippa
said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest
me to be a Christian. And
Paul said, I would to God, that not
only thou, but also all that hear me
this day, were both almost, and altogether
such as I am, except these
bonds.</p>

<p>And when he had thus spoken, the
king rose up, and the governor, and
Bernice, and they that sat with them:
and when they were gone aside, they
talked between themselves, saying,
This man doeth nothing worthy of
death or of bonds. Then said Agrippa
unto Festus, This man might have
been set at liberty, if he had not appealed
unto Cæsar.</p>

<small>PAUL SENT TO ROME</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Acts 27</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND when it was determined that
we should sail into Italy, they
delivered Paul and certain
other prisoners unto one named Julius,
a centurion of Augustus' band.
And entering into a ship of Adramyttium,
we launched, and the next
day we touched at Sidon. And Julius
courteously entreated Paul, and gave
him liberty to go unto his friends to
refresh himself. And when we had
launched from thence, we sailed under
Cyprus, because the winds were
contrary. And when we had sailed
over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia,
we came to Myra, a city of
Lycia. And there the centurion
found a ship of Alexandria sailing
into Italy; and he put us therein.
And when we had sailed slowly many
days, the wind not suffering us, we
sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
and, hardly passing it, came
unto a place which is called the Fair
Havens; nigh whereunto was the city
of Lasea. Now when much time was
spent, and when sailing was now dangerous,
because the fast was now already
past, Paul admonished them,
and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive
that this voyage will be with hurt
and much damage, not only of the
lading and ship, but also of our lives.
Nevertheless the centurion believed
the master and the owner of the ship,
more than those things which were
spoken by Paul. And when the south
wind blew softly, supposing that they
had obtained their purpose, loosing
thence, they sailed close by Crete.</div>

<p>But not long after there arose
against it a tempestuous wind. And
when the ship was caught, and could
not bear up into the wind, we let her
drive. And we being exceedingly
tossed with a tempest, the next day
they lightened the ship; and the third
day we cast out with our own hands
the tackling of the ship. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
neither sun nor stars in many days
appeared, and no small tempest lay
on us, all hope that we should be
saved was then taken away. But
after long abstinence Paul stood
forth in the midst of them, and said,
Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto
me, and not have loosed from Crete,
and to have gained this harm and
loss. And now I exhort you to be of
good cheer: for there shall be no loss
of any man's life among you, but of
the ship. For there stood by me this
night the angel of God, whose I am,
and whom I serve, saying, Fear not,
Paul; thou must be brought before
Cæsar: and, lo, God hath given thee
all them that sail with thee. Wherefore,
sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe
God, that it shall be even as it
was told me. Howbeit we must be
cast upon a certain island.</p>

<p>But when the fourteenth night was
come, as we were driven up and down
in Adria, about midnight the shipmen
deemed that they drew near to some
country. Then fearing lest we should
have fallen upon rocks, they cast four
anchors out of the stern, and wished
for the day.</p>

<p>And we were in all in the ship two
hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
And when it was day, they knew not
the land: but they discovered a certain
creek with a shore, into the which
they were minded, if it were possible,
to thrust in the ship. And falling
into a place where two seas met, they
ran the ship aground; and the forepart
stuck fast, and remained unmoveable,
but the hinder part was
broken with the violence of the waves.
And the soldiers' counsel was to kill
the prisoners, lest any of them should
swim out, and escape.</p>

<p>But the centurion, willing to save
Paul, kept them from their purpose;
and commanded that they which could
swim should cast themselves first into
the sea, and get to land: and the rest,
some on boards, and some on broken
pieces of the ship. And so it came to
pass, that they escaped all safe to
land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Acts 28</div>

<p>And when they were escaped, then
they knew that the island was called
Melita. And the barbarous people
shewed us no little kindness: for they
kindled a fire, and received us every
one, because of the present rain, and
because of the cold. And when Paul
had gathered a bundle of sticks, and
laid them on the fire, there came a
viper out of the heat, and fastened
on his hand. And when the barbarians
saw the venomous beast hang
on his hand, they said among themselves,
No doubt this man is a murderer,
whom, though he hath escaped
the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not
to live. And he shook off the beast
into the fire, and felt no harm. Howbeit
they looked when he should have
swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly:
but after they had looked a
great while, and saw no harm come
to him, they changed their minds, and
said that he was a god. And after
three months we departed in a ship
of Alexandria, which had wintered
in the isle, whose sign was Castor
and Pollux. And landing at Syracuse,
we tarried there three days: and
so we went toward Rome. And when
the brethren heard of us, they came
to meet us as far as Appii forum, and
the Three Taverns: whom when Paul
saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
And when we came to Rome,
the centurion delivered the prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
to the captain of the guard: but Paul
was suffered to dwell by himself with
a soldier that kept him. And Paul
dwelt two whole years in his own
hired house, and received all that
came in unto him, preaching the kingdom
of God, and teaching those things
which concern the Lord Jesus Christ,
with all confidence, no man forbidding
him.</p>

<small>A PART OF THE EPISTLE OF PAUL
TO THE EPHESIANS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Ephesians 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>PAUL, an apostle of Jesus
Christ by the will of God, to
the saints which are at Ephesus,
and to the faithful in Christ
Jesus: grace be to you, and peace,
from God our Father, and from the
Lord Jesus Christ. In whom we have
redemption through his blood, the
forgiveness of sins, according to the
riches of his grace. For by grace are
ye saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
not of works, lest any man should
boast. For this cause I bow my knees
unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, of whom the whole family in
heaven and earth is named, that he
would grant you, according to the
riches of his glory, to be strengthened
with might by his Spirit in the inner
man; that Christ may dwell in your
hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted
and grounded in love, may be able to
comprehend with all saints what is
the breadth, and length, and depth,
and height; and to know the love of
Christ, which passeth knowledge, that
ye might be filled with all the fulness
of God.</div>

<p>I therefore, the prisoner of the
Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy
of the vocation wherewith ye are
called, with all lowliness and meekness,
with longsuffering, forbearing
one another in love; endeavouring to
keep the unity of the Spirit in the
bond of peace. There is one body,
and one Spirit, even as ye are called
in one hope of your calling; one
Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God
and Father of all, who is above all,
and through all, and in you all.
Wherefore putting away lying, speak
every man truth with his neighbour:
for we are members one of another.
Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the
sun go down upon your wrath: neither
give place to the devil.</p>

<p>Let him that stole steal no more:
but rather let him labour, working
with his hands the thing which is
good, that he may have to give to him
that needeth. Let no corrupt communication
proceed out of your
mouth, but that which is good to the
use of edifying, that it may minister
grace unto the hearers.</p>

<p>And grieve not the holy Spirit of
God, whereby ye are sealed unto the
day of redemption. Let all bitterness,
and wrath, and anger, and clamour,
and evil speaking, be put away
from you, with all malice: and be ye
kind one to another, tenderhearted,
forgiving one another, even as God
for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.</p>

<p>Children, obey your parents in the
Lord: for this is right. And, ye fathers,
provoke not your children to
wrath: but bring them up in the nurture
and admonition of the Lord.</p>

<p>Servants, be obedient to them that
are your masters according to the
flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness
of your heart, as unto Christ;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers;
but as the servants of Christ, doing
the will of God from the heart; with
good will doing service, as to the
Lord, and not to men: knowing that
whatsoever good thing any man
doeth, the same shall he receive of
the Lord, whether he be bond or free.
And, ye masters, do the same things
unto them, forbearing threatening:
knowing that your Master also is in
heaven; neither is there respect of
persons with him.</p>

<p>Finally, my brethren, be strong in
the Lord, and in the power of his
might. Put on the whole armour of
God, that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil. Stand
therefore, having your loins girt
about with truth, and having on the
breastplate of righteousness; and
your feet shod with the preparation
of the gospel of peace; above all, taking
the shield of faith, wherewith ye
shall be able to quench all the fiery
darts of the wicked. And take the
helmet of salvation, and the sword of
the Spirit, which is the word of God:
praying always with all prayer and
supplication in the Spirit, and watching
thereunto with all perseverance
and supplication for all saints.</p>

<small>A PART OF THE EPISTLE OF PAUL
TO THE PHILIPPIANS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Philippians 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>PAUL and Timotheus, the servants
of Jesus Christ, to all
the saints in Christ Jesus
which are at Philippi, with the bishops
and deacons: grace be unto you,
and peace, from God our Father, and
from the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank
my God upon every remembrance of
you, always in every prayer of mine
for you all making request with joy,
for your fellowship in the gospel
from the first day until now; being
confident of this very thing, that he
which hath begun a good work in you
will perform it until the day of Jesus
Christ.</div>

<p>Let this mind be in you, which was
also in Christ Jesus: who, being in
the form of God, thought it not robbery
to be equal with God: but made
himself of no reputation, and took
upon him the form of a servant, and
was made in the likeness of men: and
being found in fashion as a man, he
humbled himself, and became obedient
unto death, even the death of the
cross. Wherefore God also hath
highly exalted him, and given him a
name which is above every name:
that at the name of Jesus every knee
should bow, of things in heaven, and
things in earth, and things under
the earth; and that every tongue
should confess that Jesus Christ
is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father.</p>

<p>What things were gain to me, those
I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless,
and I count all things but loss
for the excellency of the knowledge
of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom
I have suffered the loss of all things,
and do count them but dung, that I
may win Christ, and be found in him,
not having mine own righteousness,
which is of the law, but that which is
through the faith of Christ, the righteousness
which is of God by faith.
Brethren, I count not myself to have
apprehended: but this one thing
I do, forgetting those things which
are behind, and reaching forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
unto those things which are before,
I press toward the mark for the
prize of the high calling of God in
Christ Jesus. For our conversation
is in heaven; from whence also
we look for the Saviour, the Lord
Jesus Christ: who shall change
our vile body, that it may be fashioned
like unto his glorious body,
according to the working whereby he
is able even to subdue all things unto
himself.</p>

<p>Rejoice in the Lord alway: and
again I say, Rejoice. Be careful for
nothing; but in every thing by prayer
and supplication with thanksgiving
let your requests be made known unto
God. And the peace of God, which
passeth all understanding, shall keep
your hearts and minds through Christ
Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatsoever
things are true, whatsoever
things are honest, whatsoever things
are just, whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
things are of good report; if
there be any virtue, and if there be
any praise, think on these things.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
be with you all. Amen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colossians 3</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>IF ye then be risen with Christ,
seek those things which are
above, where Christ sitteth on
the right hand of God. Set your affection
on things above, not on things
on the earth. For ye are dead, and
your life is hid with Christ in God.
When Christ, who is our life, shall
appear, then shall ye also appear with
him in glory. Mortify therefore your
members which are upon the earth.
But now ye also put off all these; anger,
wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy
communication out of your mouth.
Lie not one to another, seeing that ye
have put off the old man with his
deeds; and have put on the new
man, which is renewed in knowledge
after the image of him that
created him: where there is neither
Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian,
bond nor free: but Christ is all, and
in all. Put on therefore, as the elect
of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
mercies, kindness, humbleness of
mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing
one another, and forgiving
one another, if any man have a quarrel
against any: even as Christ forgave
you, so also do ye. And above
all these things put on charity, which
is the bond of perfectness. And let
the peace of God rule in your hearts,
to the which also ye are called in one
body; and be ye thankful. Let the
word of Christ dwell in you richly in
all wisdom; teaching and admonishing
one another in psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs, singing with
grace in your hearts to the Lord.
And whatsoever ye do in word or
deed, do all in the name of the Lord
Jesus, giving thanks to God and the
Father by him; knowing that of the

<div class='drop-cap'>PAUL, an apostle of Jesus
Christ by the commandment
of God our Saviour, and Lord
Jesus Christ, which is our hope; unto
Timothy, my own son in the faith:
Grace, mercy, and peace, from God
our Father and Jesus Christ our
Lord. This is a faithful saying, and
worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save
sinners; of whom I am chief.</div>

<p>Godliness with contentment is great
gain. For we brought nothing into
this world, and it is certain we can
carry nothing out. And having food
and raiment let us be therewith content.
But they that will be rich fall
into temptation and a snare, and into
many foolish and hurtful lusts, which
drown men in destruction and perdition.
For the love of money is the
root of all evil: which while some coveted
after, they have erred from the
faith, and pierced themselves through
with many sorrows. But thou, O man
of God, flee these things; and follow
after righteousness, godliness, faith,
love, patience, meekness. Fight the
good fight of faith, lay hold on
eternal life, whereunto thou art also
called, and hast professed a good
profession before many witnesses.
Charge them that are rich in this
world, that they be not highminded,
nor trust in uncertain riches, but
in the living God, who giveth us
richly all things to enjoy; that they
do good, that they be rich in good
works, ready to distribute, willing to
communicate. Wherefore I put thee
in remembrance that thou stir up the
gift of God, which is in thee by the
putting on of my hands. Be not thou
therefore ashamed of the testimony
of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner:
but be thou partaker of the afflictions
of the gospel according to the power
of God; who hath saved us, and called
us with an holy calling, not according
to our works, but according to his own
purpose and grace, which was given
us in Christ Jesus before the world
began, but is now made manifest by
the appearing of our Saviour Jesus
Christ, who hath abolished death, and
hath brought life and immortality to
light through the gospel. For the
which cause I also suffer these things:
nevertheless I am not ashamed: for
I know whom I have believed, and
am persuaded that he is able to keep
that which I have committed unto him
against that day. Thou therefore endure
hardness, as a good soldier of
Jesus Christ. Flee also youthful
lusts: but follow righteousness, faith,
charity, peace, with them that call on
the Lord out of a pure heart. Continue
thou in the things which thou
hast learned and hast been assured
of, knowing of whom thou hast
learned them; and that from a child
thou hast known the holy scriptures,
which are able to make thee wise unto
salvation through faith which is in
Christ Jesus. All scripture is given
by inspiration of God, and is profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,
for instruction in righteousness:
that the man of God may be
perfect, throughly furnished unto all
good works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall
judge the quick and the dead at his
appearing and his kingdom; preach
the word; be instant in season, out of
season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with
all longsuffering and doctrine. For
I am now ready to be offered, and the
time of my departure is at hand. I
have fought a good fight, I have finished
my course, I have kept the
faith: henceforth there is laid up for
me a crown of righteousness, which

give me at that day: and not to me

<small>A PART OF THE EPISTLE TO
THE HEBREWS</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Hebrews 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>GOD, who at sundry times and
in divers manners spake in
time past unto the fathers by
the prophets, hath in these last days
spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
hath appointed heir of all things, by
whom also he made the worlds; who
being the brightness of his glory, and
the express image of his person, and
upholding all things by the word of
his power, when he had by himself
purged our sins, sat down on the right
hand of the Majesty on high.</div>

<p>Forasmuch then as the children are
partakers of flesh and blood, he also
himself likewise took part of the
same; that through death he might
destroy him that had the power of
death, that is, the devil. Wherefore in
all things it behoved him to be made
like unto his brethren, that he might
be a merciful and faithful high priest
in things pertaining to God, to make
reconciliation for the sins of the people.
For in that he himself hath suffered
being tempted, he is able to
succour them that are tempted.</p>

<p>Seeing then that we have a great
high priest, that is passed into the
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us
hold fast our profession. For we
have not an high priest which cannot
be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities; but was in all points
tempted like as we are, yet without
sin. Let us therefore come boldly
unto the throne of grace, that we may
obtain mercy, and find grace to help
in time of need. And truly there
were many priests, because they were
not suffered to continue by reason of
death: but this man, because he continueth
ever, hath an unchangeable
priesthood. Wherefore he is able
also to save them to the uttermost that
come unto God by him, seeing he ever
liveth to make intercession for them.
For such an high priest became us,
who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate
from sinners, and made higher
than the heavens; who needeth not
daily, as those high priests, to offer
up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and
then for the people's: for this he did
once, when he offered up himself. So
Christ was once offered to bear the
sins of many; and unto them that look
for him shall he appear the second
time without sin unto salvation.</p>

<p>For it is not possible that the blood
of bulls and of goats should take away
sins. Wherefore when he cometh into
the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering
thou wouldest not, but a body
hast thou prepared me: in burnt offerings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
and sacrifices for sin thou hast
had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I
come (in the volume of the book it
is written of me,) to do thy will, O
God. By the which will we are sanctified
through the offering of the
body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>

<p>Having therefore, brethren, boldness
to enter into the holiest by the
blood of Jesus, by a new and living
way, which he hath consecrated for
us, through the veil, that is to say, his
flesh; and having an high priest over
the house of God; let us draw near
with a true heart in full assurance of
faith, having our hearts sprinkled
from an evil conscience, and our
bodies washed with pure water. Let
us hold fast the profession of our
faith without wavering; for he is
faithful that promised.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hebrews 11</div>

<p>Now faith is the substance of things
hoped for, the evidence of things not
seen. Through faith we understand
that the worlds were framed by the
word of God, so that things which are
seen were not made of things which
do appear. Without faith it is impossible
to please God: for he that
cometh to God must believe that he
is, and that he is a rewarder of them
that diligently seek him. By faith
Noah, being warned of God of things
not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared
an ark to the saving of his
house; by the which he condemned
the world, and became heir of the
righteousness which is by faith. By
faith Abraham, when he was called
to go out into a place which he should
after receive for an inheritance,
obeyed; and he went out, not knowing
whither he went. By faith he sojourned
in the land of promise, as in
a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles
with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs
with him of the same promise: for he
looked for a city which hath foundations,
whose builder and maker is
God. By faith Abraham, when he
was tried, offered up Isaac: and he
that had received the promises offered
up his only begotten son. By
faith Moses, when he was come to
years, refused to be called the son of
Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather
to suffer affliction with the people of
God, than to enjoy the pleasures of
sin for a season; esteeming the reproach
of Christ greater riches than
the treasures in Egypt: for he had
respect unto the recompence of the
reward. By faith he forsook Egypt,
not fearing the wrath of the king: for
he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</p>

<p>And what shall I more say? for the
time would fail me to tell of Gedeon,
and of Barak, and of Samson, and of
Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel,
and of the prophets: who through
faith subdued kingdoms, wrought
righteousness, obtained promises,
stopped the mouths of lions, quenched
the violence of fire, escaped the edge
of the sword, out of weakness were
made strong, waxed valiant in fight,
turned to flight the armies of the
aliens. Women received their dead
raised to life again: and others were
tortured, not accepting deliverance;
that they might obtain a better resurrection:
and others had trial of cruel
mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover
of bonds and imprisonment:
they were stoned, they were sawn
asunder, were tempted, were slain
with the sword: they wandered about
in sheepskins and goatskins; being
destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
whom the world was not worthy:)
they wandered in deserts, and in
mountains, and in dens and caves of
the earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hebrews 12</div>

<p>Wherefore seeing we also are compassed
about with so great a cloud of
witnesses, let us lay aside every
weight, and the sin which doth so
easily beset us, and let us run with
patience the race that is set before
us, looking unto Jesus the author and
finisher of our faith; who for the joy
that was set before him endured the
cross, despising the shame, and is set
down at the right hand of the throne
of God. For consider him that endured
such contradiction of sinners
against himself, lest ye be wearied
and faint in your minds. Ye have
not yet resisted unto blood, striving
against sin. And ye have forgotten
the exhortation which speaketh unto
you as unto children, My son, despise
not thou the chastening of the Lord,
nor faint when thou art rebuked of
him: for whom the Lord loveth he
chasteneth, and scourgeth every son
whom he receiveth. If ye endure
chastening, God dealeth with you as
with sons; for what son is he whom
the father chasteneth not? Now no
chastening for the present seemeth
to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless
afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
fruit of righteousness unto them
which are exercised thereby. Follow
peace with all men, and holiness,
without which no man shall see the
Lord.</p>

<p>Let brotherly love continue. Be
not forgetful to entertain strangers:
for thereby some have entertained
angels unawares. Let your conversation
be without covetousness; and be
content with such things as ye have:
for he hath said, I will never leave
thee, nor forsake thee. So that we
may boldly say, The Lord is my
helper, and I will not fear what man
shall do unto me. Remember them
which have the rule over you, who
have spoken unto you the word of
God: whose faith follow, considering
the end of their conversation. Jesus
Christ the same yesterday, and to
day, and for ever.</p>

<h2>BOOK V&mdash;LETTERS OF JAMES, PETER, AND JOHN</h2>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_95_2" id="CHAPTER_95_2">CHAPTER 95</a><br />

<small>A PART OF THE EPISTLE OF JAMES</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-j.jpg" width="150" height="176" alt="J" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">JAMES, a servant
of God and of the
Lord Jesus Christ,
to the twelve
tribes which are
scattered abroad,
greeting. My
brethren, count
it all joy when
ye fall into divers temptations; knowing
this, that the trying of your faith
worketh patience. But let patience
have her perfect work, that ye may
be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
If any of you lack wisdom, let
him ask of God, that giveth to all men
liberally, and upbraideth not; and
it shall be given him. But let him
ask in faith, nothing wavering. For
he that wavereth is like a wave of the
sea driven with the wind and tossed.
For let not that man think that he
shall receive any thing of the Lord.
A double minded man is unstable in
all his ways. Let the brother of low
degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
but the rich, in that he is made low:
because as the flower of the grass he
shall pass away. For the sun is no
sooner risen with a burning heat, but
it withereth the grass, and the flower
thereof falleth, and the grace of the
fashion of it perisheth: so also shall
the rich man fade away in his ways.
Blessed is the man that endureth
temptation: for when he is tried, he
shall receive the crown of life, which
the Lord hath promised to them that
love him. Let no man say when he
is tempted, I am tempted of God: for
God cannot be tempted with evil, neither
tempteth he any man: but every
man is tempted, when he is drawn
away of his own lust, and enticed. Do
not err, my beloved brethren. Every
good gift and every perfect gift is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
from above, and cometh down from
the Father of lights, with whom is no
variableness, neither shadow of turning.
Of his own will begat he us with
the word of truth, that we should be a
kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let
every man be swift to hear, slow to
speak, slow to wrath: for the wrath
of man worketh not the righteousness
of God. Wherefore lay apart all
filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness,
and receive with meekness the
engrafted word, which is able to save
your souls. But be ye doers of the
word, and not hearers only, deceiving
your own selves. For if any be a
hearer of the word, and not a doer,
he is like unto a man beholding his
natural face in a glass: for he beholdeth
himself, and goeth his way, and
straightway forgetteth what manner
of man he was. But whoso looketh
into the perfect law of liberty, and
continueth therein, he being not a forgetful
hearer, but a doer of the work,
this man shall be blessed in his deed.
Pure religion and undefiled before
God and the Father is this, To visit
the fatherless and widows in their
affliction, and to keep himself unspotted
from the world.</div>

<div class="sidenote">James 2</div>

<p>My brethren, have not the faith of
our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of
glory, with respect of persons. For if
there come unto your assembly a man
with a gold ring, in goodly apparel,
and there come in also a poor man in
vile raiment; and ye have respect to
him that weareth the gay clothing,
and say unto him, Sit thou here in a
good place; and say to the poor, Stand
thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
are ye not then partial in yourselves,
and are become judges of evil
thoughts? Hearken, my beloved
brethren, Hath not God chosen the
poor of this world rich in faith, and
heirs of the kingdom which he hath
promised to them that love him?</p>

<p>For he shall have judgment without
mercy, that hath shewed no
mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against
judgment. What doth it profit, my
brethren, though a man say he hath
faith, and have not works? can faith
save him? If a brother or sister
be naked, and destitute of daily
food, and one of you say unto them,
Depart in peace, be ye warmed and
filled; notwithstanding ye give them
not those things which are needful
to the body; what doth it profit?
Even so faith, if it hath not works,
is dead, being alone. Yea, a man
may say, Thou hast faith, and I
have works: shew me thy faith without
thy works, and I will shew thee
my faith by my works. Thou believest
that there is one God; thou doest
well: the devils also believe, and
tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain
man, that faith without works is
dead? Was not Abraham our father
justified by works, when he had offered
Isaac his son upon the altar?
Seest thou how faith wrought with
his works, and by works was faith
made perfect? And the scripture was
fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed
God, and it was imputed unto
him for righteousness: and he was
called the Friend of God. Ye see
then how that by works a man is justified,
and not by faith only.</p>

<p>My brethren, be not many masters,
knowing that we shall receive the
greater condemnation. For in many
things we offend all. If any man
offend not in word, the same is a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
man, and able also to bridle the
whole body. Behold, we put bits in
the horses' mouths, that they may
obey us; and we turn about their
whole body. Behold also the ships,
which though they be so great, and
are driven of fierce winds, yet are
they turned about with a very small
helm, whithersoever the governor
listeth. Even so the tongue is a little
member, and boasteth great things.
Behold, how great a matter a little
fire kindleth! And the tongue is a
fire, a world of iniquity: so is the
tongue among our members, that it
defileth the whole body, and setteth
on fire the course of nature; and it
is set on fire of hell. For every kind
of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents,
and of things in the sea, is
tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
but the tongue can no man
tame; it is an unruly evil, full of
deadly poison. Therewith bless we
God, even the Father; and therewith
curse we men, which are made after
the similitude of God. Out of the
same mouth proceedeth blessing and
cursing. My brethren, these things
ought not so to be. Doth a fountain
send forth at the same place sweet
water and bitter? Can the fig tree,
my brethren, bear olive berries?
either a vine, figs? so can no fountain
both yield salt water and fresh. Who
is a wise man and endued with knowledge
among you? let him shew out
of a good conversation his works with
meekness of wisdom. But if ye have
bitter envying and strife in your
hearts, glory not, and lie not against
the truth. For where envying and
strife is, there is confusion and every
evil work. But the wisdom that is
from above is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, and easy to be intreated,
full of mercy and good fruits, without
partiality, and without hypocrisy.
And the fruit of righteousness is sown
in peace of them that make peace.
Behold, we count them happy which
endure. Ye have heard of the patience
of Job, and have seen the end
of the Lord; that the Lord is very
pitiful, and of tender mercy. But
above all things, my brethren, swear
not, neither by heaven, neither by the
earth, neither by any other oath: but
let your yea be yea; and your nay,
nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.
Is any among you afflicted? let him
pray. Is any merry? let him sing
psalms. Is any sick among you? let
him call for the elders of the church;
and let them pray over him, anointing
him with oil in the name of the
Lord: and the prayer of faith shall
save the sick, and the Lord shall raise
him up; and if he have committed
sins, they shall be forgiven him. Confess
your faults one to another, and
pray one for another, that ye may
be healed. The effectual fervent
prayer of a righteous man availeth
much. Let him know, that he which
converteth the sinner from the error
of his way shall save a soul from
death, and shall hide a multitude of
sins.</p>

<small>A PART OF THE EPISTLES
OF PETER</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. Peter 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>PETER, an apostle of Jesus
Christ, to the strangers scattered
throughout Pontus, Galatia,
Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
Blessed be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
according to his abundant mercy hath
begotten us again unto a lively hope
by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible,
and undefiled, and that
fadeth not away, reserved in heaven
for you, who are kept by the power
of God through faith unto salvation.</div>

<div class="sidenote">I. Peter 2</div>

<p>But as he which hath called you is
holy, so be ye holy in all manner
of conversation. Wherefore laying
aside all malice, and all guile, and
hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil
speakings, as newborn babes, desire
the sincere milk of the word, that ye
may grow thereby. Honour all men.
Love the brotherhood. Fear God.
Honour the king. This is thankworthy,
if a man for conscience toward
God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
For even hereunto were ye
called: because Christ also suffered
for us, leaving us an example, that
ye should follow his steps: who did
no sin, neither was guile found in his
mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled
not again; when he suffered, he
threatened not; but committed himself
to him that judgeth righteously:
who his own self bare our sins in his
own body on the tree, that we, being
dead to sins, should live unto righteousness:
by whose stripes ye were
healed. For ye were as sheep going
astray; but are now returned unto the
Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
Finally, be ye all of one mind, having
compassion one of another, love as
brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not
rendering evil for evil, or railing for
railing: but contrariwise blessing;
knowing that ye are thereunto called,
that ye should inherit a blessing. The
end of all things is at hand: be ye
therefore sober, and watch unto
prayer. And above all things have
fervent charity among yourselves:
for charity shall cover the multitude
of sins. Likewise, ye younger, submit
yourselves unto the elder. Yea,
all of you be subject one to another,
and be clothed with humility: for
God resisteth the proud, and giveth
grace to the humble. Humble yourselves
therefore under the mighty
hand of God, that he may exalt you
in due time: casting all your care
upon him; for he careth for you. Be
sober, be vigilant; because your adversary
the devil, as a roaring lion,
walketh about, seeking whom he may
devour.</p>

<p>I think it meet, as long as I am in
this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting
you in remembrance; knowing
that shortly I must put off this my
tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus
Christ hath shewed me.</p>

<p>But, beloved, be not ignorant of
this one thing, that one day is
with the Lord as a thousand years,
and a thousand years as one day.
The Lord is not slack concerning
his promise, as some men count
slackness; but is longsuffering to
us-ward, not willing that any should
perish, but that all should come to
repentance. But the day of the
Lord will come as a thief in the
night; in the which the heavens shall
pass away with a great noise, and the
elements shall melt with fervent heat,
the earth also and the works that are
therein shall be burned up. Seeing
then that all these things shall be dissolved,
what manner of persons ought
ye to be in all holy conversation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
godliness? Nevertheless we, according
to his promise, look for new
heavens and a new earth, wherein
dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore,
beloved, seeing that ye look for such
things, be diligent that ye may be
found of him in peace, without spot,
and blameless.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_97_2" id="CHAPTER_97_2">CHAPTER 97</a><br />

<small>A PART OF THE FIRST EPISTLE
OF JOHN</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">I. John 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THAT which we have seen and
heard declare we unto you,
that ye also may have fellowship
with us: and truly our fellowship
is with the Father, and with his Son
Jesus Christ. This then is the message
which we have heard of him, and
declare unto you, that God is light,
and in him is no darkness at all. If
we say that we have fellowship with
him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and
do not the truth: but if we walk in the
light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship
one with another, and the
blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth
us from all sin. If we say that
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us. If we confess
our sins, he is faithful and just
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse
us from all unrighteousness. If we
say that we have not sinned, we
make him a liar, and his word is not
in us.</div>

<p>My little children, these things
write I unto you, that ye sin not. And
if any man sin, we have an advocate
with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous: and he is the propitiation
for our sins: and not for ours
only, but also for the sins of the
whole world. And hereby we do
know that we know him, if we keep
his commandments. He that saith, I
know him, and keepeth not his commandments,
is a liar, and the truth is
not in him. But whoso keepeth his
word, in him verily is the love of God
perfected: hereby know we that we
are in him. He that saith he abideth
in him ought himself also so to walk,
even as he walked. He that saith he
is in the light, and hateth his brother,
is in darkness even until now. He
that loveth his brother abideth in the
light, and there is none occasion of
stumbling in him. I write unto you,
little children, because your sins are
forgiven you for his name's sake.
Love not the world, neither the things
that are in the world. If any man
love the world, the love of the Father
is not in him. For all that is in the
world, the lust of the flesh, and the
lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,
is not of the Father, but is of the
world. And the world passeth away,
and the lust thereof: but he that doeth
the will of God abideth for ever.</p>

<p>Behold, what manner of love the
Father hath bestowed upon us, that
we should be called the sons of God:
therefore the world knoweth us not,
because it knew him not. Beloved,
now are we the sons of God, and it
doth not yet appear what we shall be:
but we know that, when he shall appear,
we shall be like him; for we
shall see him as he is. And every
man that hath this hope in him purifieth
himself, even as he is pure.</p>

<p>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth
also the law: for sin is the
transgression of the law. And ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
know that he was manifested to take
away our sins; and in him is no sin.</p>

<p>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth
not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen
him, neither known him. Whosoever
doeth not righteousness is not of God,
neither he that loveth not his brother.
For this is the message that ye heard
from the beginning, that we should
love one another.</p>

<p>Hereby perceive we the love of
God, because he laid down his life for
us: and we ought to lay down our
lives for the brethren. But whoso
hath this world's good, and seeth his
brother have need, and shutteth up
his bowels of compassion from him,
how dwelleth the love of God in him?
My little children, let us not love in
word, neither in tongue; but in deed
and in truth. Beloved, let us love one
another: for love is of God; and
every one that loveth is born of
God, and knoweth God. He that
loveth not knoweth not God; for
God is love. In this was manifested
the love of God toward us,
because that God sent his only begotten
Son into the world, that we
might live through him. Herein is
love, not that we loved God, but that
he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
propitiation for our sins. Beloved,
if God so loved us, we ought also to
love one another. No man hath seen
God at any time. If we love one another,
God dwelleth in us, and his love
is perfected in us. Hereby know we
that we dwell in him, and he in us,
because he hath given us of his Spirit.
And we have seen and do testify that
the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour
of the world. Whosoever shall
confess that Jesus is the Son of God,
God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
And we have known and believed the
love that God hath to us. God is love;
and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth
in God, and God in him. Herein is
our love made perfect, that we may
have boldness in the day of judgment:
because as he is, so are we in this
world. There is no fear in love; but
perfect love casteth out fear: because
fear hath torment. He that feareth
is not made perfect in love. We love
him, because he first loved us. If a
man say, I love God, and hateth his
brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth
not his brother whom he hath seen,
how can he love God whom he hath
not seen? And this commandment
have we from him, that he who loveth
God love his brother also.</p>

<small>JOHN TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES
OF ASIA</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Rev. 1</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>JOHN to the seven churches
which are in Asia: Grace be
unto you, and peace, from him
which is, and which was, and which
is to come; and from Jesus Christ,
who is the faithful witness, and the
first begotten of the dead, and the
prince of the kings of the earth. Unto
him that loved us, and washed us
from our sins in his own blood, and
hath made us kings and priests unto
God and his Father; to him be glory
and dominion for ever and ever.
Amen.</div>

<p>Behold, he cometh with clouds; and
every eye shall see him, and they also
which pierced him: and all kindreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
of the earth shall wail because of him.
Even so, Amen.</p>

<p>I John, who also am your brother,
and companion in tribulation, and in
the kingdom and patience of Jesus
Christ, was in the isle that is called
Patmos, for the word of God, and for
the testimony of Jesus Christ. I was
in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and
heard behind me a great voice, as of
a trumpet, saying, I am Alpha and
Omega, the first and the last: and,
What thou seest, write in a book, and
send it unto the seven churches which
are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto
Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and
unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and
unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
And I turned to see the voice that
spake with me. And being turned,
I saw seven golden candlesticks; and
in the midst of the seven candlesticks
one like unto the Son of man, clothed
with a garment down to the foot, and
girt about the paps with a golden girdle.
His head and his hairs were
white like wool, as white as snow; and
his eyes were as a flame of fire; and
his feet like unto fine brass, as if they
burned in a furnace; and his voice as
the sound of many waters. And he
had in his right hand seven stars: and
out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
sword: and his countenance
was as the sun shineth in his strength.
And when I saw him, I fell at his feet
as dead. And he laid his right hand
upon me, saying unto me, Fear not;
I am the first and the last: I am he
that liveth, and was dead; and, behold,
I am alive for evermore, Amen;
and have the keys of hell and of death.
Write the things which thou hast
seen, and the things which are, and
the things which shall be hereafter.</p>

<small>THE THRONE AND THE LAMB</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Rev. 4</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AFTER this I looked, and, behold,
a door was opened in heaven:
and the first voice which I
heard was as it were of a trumpet
talking with me; which said, Come up
hither, and I will shew thee things
which must be hereafter. And immediately
I was in the spirit: and,
behold, a throne was set in heaven,
and one sat on the throne. And he
that sat was to look upon like a jasper
and a sardine stone: and there was
a rainbow round about the throne, in
sight like unto an emerald. And
round about the throne were four and
twenty seats: and upon the seats I
saw four and twenty elders sitting,
clothed in white raiment; and they
had on their heads crowns of gold.
And out of the throne proceeded
lightnings and thunderings and
voices: and there were seven lamps
of fire burning before the throne,
which are the seven Spirits of God.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rev. 7</div>

<p>And before the throne there was
a sea of glass like unto crystal: and
in the midst of the throne, and round
about the throne, were four beasts full
of eyes before and behind. And I
saw in the right hand of him that sat
on the throne a book written within
and on the backside, sealed with seven
seals. And I beheld, and, lo, in the
midst stood a Lamb as it had been
slain, having seven horns and seven
eyes, which are the seven Spirits of
God sent forth into all the earth. And
he came and took the book out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
right hand of him that sat upon the
throne. And when he had taken the
book, the four beasts and four and
twenty elders fell down before the
Lamb, having every one of them
harps, and golden vials full of odours,
which are the prayers of saints. And
they sung a new song, saying, Thou
art worthy to take the book, and to
open the seals thereof: for thou wast
slain, and hast redeemed us to God
by thy blood out of every kindred,
and tongue, and people, and nation;
and hast made us unto our God kings
and priests: and we shall reign on the
earth. And I beheld, and I heard the
voice of many angels round about the
throne: and the number of them was
ten thousand times ten thousand, and
thousands of thousands; saying with
a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that
was slain to receive power, and riches,
and wisdom, and strength, and honour,
and glory, and blessing. And
every creature which is in heaven,
and on the earth, and under the earth,
and such as are in the sea, and all that
are in them, heard I saying, Blessing,
and honour, and glory, and power, be
unto him that sitteth upon the throne,
and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
After this I beheld, and, lo, a great
multitude, which no man could number,
of all nations, and kindreds, and
people, and tongues, stood before the
throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
with white robes, and palms in their
hands; and cried with a loud voice,
saying, Salvation to our God which
sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
Lamb. And all the angels stood
round about the throne, and about the
elders and the four beasts, and fell
before the throne on their faces, and
worshipped God, saying, Blessing,
and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving,
and honour, and power, and
might, be unto our God for ever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<p>And one of the elders answered,
saying unto me, What are these which
are arrayed in white robes? and
whence came they? And I said unto
him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said
to me, These are they which came out
of great tribulation, and have washed
their robes, and made them white in
the blood of the Lamb. Therefore
are they before the throne of God,
and serve him day and night in his
temple: and he that sitteth on the
throne shall dwell among them. They
shall hunger no more, neither thirst
any more; neither shall the sun light
on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb
which is in the midst of the throne
shall feed them, and shall lead them
unto living fountains of waters: and
God shall wipe away all tears from
their eyes.</p>

<p>And I saw another mighty angel
come down from heaven, clothed with
a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his
head, and his face was as it were the
sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: and
he had in his hand a little book open:
and he set his right foot upon the sea,
and his left foot on the earth, and
cried with a loud voice, as when a
lion roareth: and when he had cried,
seven thunders uttered their voices.
And when the seven thunders had uttered
their voices, I was about to
write: and I heard a voice from heaven
saying unto me, Seal up those
things which the seven thunders uttered,
and write them not. And the
angel which I saw stand upon the sea
and upon the earth lifted up his hand
to heaven, and sware by him that liveth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
for ever and ever, who created
heaven, and the things that therein
are, and the earth, and the things that
therein are, and the sea, and the
things which are therein, that there
should be time no longer.</p>

<p>And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood
on the mount Sion, and with him an
hundred forty and four thousand,
having his Father's name written in
their foreheads. And I heard a voice
from heaven, as the voice of many
waters, and as the voice of a great
thunder: and I heard the voice of
harpers harping with their harps:
and they sung as it were a new song
before the throne, and before the four
beasts, and the elders: and no man
could learn that song but the hundred
and forty and four thousand, which
were redeemed from the earth. And
in their mouth was found no guile:
for they are without fault before the
throne of God.</p>

<p>And I saw another angel fly in the
midst of heaven, having the everlasting
gospel to preach unto them that
dwell on the earth, and to every nation,
and kindred, and tongue, and
people, saying with a loud voice, Fear
God, and give glory to him; for the
hour of his judgment is come: and
worship him that made heaven, and
earth, and the sea, and the fountains
of waters. Here is the patience of the
saints: here are they that keep the
commandments of God, and the faith
of Jesus. And I heard a voice from
heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
are the dead which die in the Lord
from henceforth: Yea, saith the
Spirit, that they may rest from their
labours; and their works do follow
them. And I looked, and behold a
white cloud, and upon the cloud one
sat like unto the Son of man, having
on his head a golden crown, and in
his hand a sharp sickle. And another
angel came out of the temple, crying
with a loud voice to him that sat on
the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and
reap: for the time is come for thee
to reap; for the harvest of the earth
is ripe. And he that sat on the cloud
thrust in his sickle on the earth; and
the earth was reaped. And another
angel came out of the temple which
is in heaven, he also having a sharp
sickle. And another angel came out
from the altar, which had power over
fire; and cried with a loud cry to him
that had the sharp sickle, saying,
Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather
the clusters of the vine of the earth;
for her grapes are fully ripe. And
the angel thrust in his sickle into the
earth, and gathered the vine of the
earth, and cast it into the great winepress
of the wrath of God. And the
winepress was trodden without the
city, and blood came out of the winepress,
even unto the horse bridles, by
the space of a thousand and six hundred
furlongs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rev. 17</div>

<p>And I saw as it were a sea of glass
mingled with fire: and them that had
gotten the victory stand on the sea of
glass, having the harps of God. And
they sing the song of Moses the servant
of God, and the song of the
Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous
are thy works, Lord God Almighty;
just and true are thy ways, thou King
of saints. Who shall not fear thee, O
Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou
only art holy. And a voice came out
of the throne, saying, Praise our God,
all ye his servants, and ye that fear
him, both small and great. And I
heard as it were the voice of a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
multitude, and as the voice of many
waters, and as the voice of mighty
thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the
Lord God omnipotent reigneth. And
I saw a great white throne, and him
that sat on it, from whose face the
earth and the heaven fled away; and
there was found no place for them.
And I saw the dead, small and great,
stand before God; and the books
were opened: and another book was
opened, which is the book of life: and
the dead were judged out of those
things which were written in the
books, according to their works. And
the sea gave up the dead which were
in it; and death and hell delivered up
the dead which were in them: and
they were judged every man according
to their works.</p>

<small>THE NEW JERUSALEM</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Rev. 21</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AND I saw a new heaven and a
new earth: for the first heaven
and the first earth were
passed away; and there was no more
sea. And I John saw the holy city,
new Jerusalem, coming down from
God out of heaven, prepared as a
bride adorned for her husband. And
I heard a great voice out of heaven
saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God
is with men, and he will dwell with
them, and they shall be his people,
and God himself shall be with them,
and be their God. And God shall
wipe away all tears from their eyes;
and there shall be no more death, neither
sorrow, nor crying, neither shall
there be any more pain: for the former
things are passed away. And
he that sat upon the throne said,
Behold, I make all things new. And
he said unto me, Write: for these
words are true and faithful. And he
said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha
and Omega, the beginning and the
end. I will give unto him that is
athirst of the fountain of the water
of life freely. He that overcometh
shall inherit all things; and I will be
his God, and he shall be my son. And
the city had no need of the sun, neither
of the moon, to shine in it: for
the glory of God did lighten it, and
the Lamb is the light thereof. And
the gates of it shall not be shut at all
by day: for there shall be no night
there. And there shall in no wise
enter into it any thing that defileth,
neither whatsoever worketh abomination,
or maketh a lie: but they which
are written in the Lamb's book of
life.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rev. 22</div>

<p>And he shewed me a pure river of
water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding
out of the throne of God and
of the Lamb. In the midst of the
street of it, and on either side of the
river, was there the tree of life, which
bare twelve manner of fruits, and
yielded her fruit every month: and
the leaves of the tree were for the
healing of the nations. And there
shall be no more curse: but the throne
of God and of the Lamb shall be in it;
and his servants shall serve him: and
they shall see his face; and his name
shall be in their foreheads. And
there shall be no night there; and
they need no candle, neither light of
the sun; for the Lord God giveth them
light: and they shall reign for ever
and ever.</p>

<p>And he said unto me, These sayings
are faithful and true: and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
Lord God of the holy prophets sent
his angel to shew unto his servants
the things which must shortly
be done. Behold, I come quickly:
blessed is he that keepeth the sayings
of the prophecy of this book. And
I John saw these things, and heard
them. And when I had heard and
seen, I fell down to worship before
the feet of the angel which shewed
me these things. Then saith he unto
me, See thou do it not: for I am thy
fellowservant, and of thy brethren the
prophets, and of them which keep the
sayings of this book: worship God.
And he saith unto me, Seal not the
sayings of the prophecy of this book:
for the time is at hand. He that is
unjust, let him be unjust still: and he
which is filthy, let him be filthy
still: and he that is righteous, let
him be righteous still: and he that
is holy, let him be holy still. And,
behold, I come quickly; and my
reward is with me, to give every
man according as his work shall be.
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning
and the end, the first and the
last. Blessed are they that do his
commandments, that they may have
right to the tree of life, and may enter
in through the gates into the city. I
Jesus have sent mine angel to testify
unto you these things in the churches.
I am the root and the offspring of
David, and the bright and morning
star. And the Spirit and the bride
say, Come. And let him that heareth
say, Come. And let him that is
athirst come. And whosoever will,
let him take the water of life freely.
He which testifieth these things saith,
Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even
so, come, Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
be with you all. Amen.</p>
